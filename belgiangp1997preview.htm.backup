            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;There is no
            other corner in the world like Eau Rouge ... no
            matter how many times you drive it, you always get
            that tingle of pleasure that is part of what motor
            racing is all about.&quot; </i><b><i>Ferrari driver,
            Michael Schumacher</i></b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The circuit at Spa is
            thought by many drivers to be the finest in the F1
            calendar. &#145;A drivers circuit&#146; they say, a
            track to make you feel like a real racer. Consisting
            partly of public road and purpose built track, it was
            the inspiration of one <i>Jules de Their</i> who
            mapped out the original 14.08Km course on the country
            roads that run through the hills and thick woods of
            the Ardennes in 1924.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Stewart </b>Technical
            director <b>Alan Jenkins</b> waxed lyrical about Spa
            recently. <i>&quot;You could call Spa the fastest
            street track in the world. Spa has an atmosphere, a
            feel all of its own: It&#146;s one of those great
            motor racing places where the history is engraved on
            the tarmac and in the whole surroundings. In a sense,
            there would be even greater satisfaction to being
            competitive at Spa than anywhere else, precisely
            because of the stresses such a great circuit places
            not only on the aerodynamics and engineering of the
            car but on the skills of the driver.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Its History has been
            incident filled and not without tragedy. <b>Stefan
            Bellof</b> the World Sports car champion was killed
            in 1984 at the Spa 1000 after bottoming out at <i>Eau
            Rouge,</i> probably the most demanding piece of track
            anywhere on the current F1 calendar. Serious injuries
            for <b>Stirling Moss</b> and the deaths of two
            Drivers in the same Grand prix sounded the death
            knell for the old circuit and like the <i>Nurburgring</i>,
            it fell out of favour. The last Grand Prix on the old
            circuit was in 1970. Three further fatal casualties
            during the 24 Hr endurance race in 1973, have added
            to Spa&#146;s awesome reputation as a circuit that
            does not suffer fools gladly.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After short stints at
            both <i>Nivelles, </i>near Brussels<i> </i>and <i>Zolder</i>,
            racing recommenced there in 1983 after extensive
            modernisation and the addition of a new section
            bridging the old course at <i>Malmedy</i> and <i>Stavelot</i>,
            drastically shortening the track to 6.96Km. Spa has
            been the regular home to F1 since 1985.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Ardennes area is
            notorious for its fickle weather and as the clouds
            sweep through the valleys of these verdant hills,
            across the town of Spa to the north, the circuit can
            change to a lake in the time it takes to do a lap.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The race last year saw
            the championship gap narrow as <b>Jacques Villeneuve </b>took
            second place to <b>Michael Schumacher </b>and, <b>Damon
            Hill</b> driving the spar car, finish in 5th place
            after bungled radio communications forced him to
            abort his pit stop during a &#145;yellow flag&#146;
            incident involving <b>Jos Verstappen</b>&#146;s <b>TWR
            Arrows</b>. Hill was forced to weave his way back out
            onto the circuit through the bollards and pit a lap
            later forcing him down to 13th position behind the
            gaggle of cars following the pace car. Schumacher
            scraped past Villeneuve as the Canadian was exiting
            the pit-lane after his final stop and went on to take
            the all important ten points from Villeneuve so
            lessening the severity of Hill&#146;s points deficit.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The McLarens did well
            also with <b>David Coulthard</b> making one of his
            usual quick getaways and briefly leading the race
            during the pit stops. He went off 5 laps from the end
            leaving his team mate <b>Mika Hakinnen</b> to take
            third place.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ferrari </b>has the
            best <i>Belgium Grand Prix</i> record, having won the
            race nine times and in the heady days of 1961 when
            more than two cars were permitted to compete, they
            took a definitive 1, 2, 3, 4, <b>Phil Hill</b>
            winning from pole position ahead of <b>Wolfgang Von
            Trips</b>. In recent years with the <i>&#145;Schumacher
            factor&#146;</i>, the statistics become even further
            entwined. 1991 saw the German drive his first ever
            Grand Prix, when <b>Eddie Jordan</b> called him in
            desperation at his home in Karpen, Germany, only 75
            miles to the South. Jordan&#146;s regular driver, <b>Bertrand
            Gachot</b>, had just been arrested for spraying mace
            into the face of a London cabby that he had taken a
            dislike to. The following year he took his first ever
            GP win in a <b>Benetton-Ford</b>. Amid all the knee
            jerk reactions and rulings that the FIA passed In
            1994, the year that <b>Ayrton Senna</b> died,
            Schumacher won the race again but was disqualified
            for undue wear on the &#145;plank&#146; that all cars
            were forced to wear beneath the chassis to reduce
            &#145;ground effect&#146;. With the reliability and
            turn of power that Ferrari have been exhibiting this
            year, fortune could fall to the <i>Scuderia</i> yet
            again.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After Hill&#146;s
            fantastic showing at the <i>Hungaroring</i> recently,
            it will of necessity, be back to reality for the <b>TWR</b>
            team. With down force at a minimum and speed and
            perfect balance a priority, The underpowered <b>Arrows
            Yamaha</b> will be totally out of its depth, but no
            doubt the re-found experience of a podium finish and
            the recently announced pregnancy of wife <b>Georgie</b>,
            could spur Hill on to give us a great performance, if
            not a winning one. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <b>Jordan
            Peugeot&#146;s</b> always do well where there are
            long periods of time spent at full throttle and high
            engine speed. Current <i>wunderkind</i> <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b> having only raced in the <b>ITC</b>
            championships at the circuit said. <i>&quot;I think
            Spa is possibly the best circuit in the world. It
            made a big impression on me when I raced for Peugeot
            earlier this year. Eau Rouge and Raidillon must be
            two of the most difficult corners made even harder by
            the very long straight which follows them.&quot; </i>Team
            mate <b>Ralf Schumacher</b> said of Spa,<i> &quot;I
            hope not to be disappointed when I race at Spa in
            Formula 1, but I think I will feel more comfortable
            than I did in the GTI AMG Mercedes last year, because
            I will be driving levels of downforce and speed which
            I am more used to.&quot; </i>Lets hope so too for <b>Eddie
            Jordan</b>&#146;s sake.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If it rains - and
            there is statistically a fifty percent chance - then
            the race could be anybody&#146;s. <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b> is now knocking on the door of <b>Schumacher</b>&#146;s
            slender lead and bar any stupid pit errors, he could
            give the <b>Ferrari </b>a close run battle. However,
            with the second &#145;light&#146; chassis prepared
            for the current leader, <b>Ferrari</b> seem to have
            the advantage. This is Schumacher&#146;s
            &#145;chosen&#146; circuit and &#145;home&#146; race
            after all. <i>&quot;We should be competitive in our
            Ferraris.&quot;</i> He said this week, <i>&quot;...
            and my brother Ralf, will gain a special experience
            on a great track.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are more
            overtaking places than other circuits, so the
            bravehearts that take their bottle to the limit at <i>Spa-Francorchamps</i>,
            will surely get the glory. There is never a dull race
            at Spa but it is inevitable that with such a power
            circuit, the wolves that run at the head of the pack
            have the greatest chance of catching their prey.</font></p>
