            admitted to letting his emotions get the better of
            him after winning the Australian Grand Prix for
            McLaren last Sunday (9th). &quot;What a fantastic
            start to the season and I must be honest to admit
            that I shed a few tears in the car on the slowing
            down lap.&quot; Coulthard who held a 20 second
            advantage over Michael Schumacher in the Ferrari
            after 58 grueling laps round the 3.274 mile Albert
            Park circuit also said, &quot; Certainly having
            Schumacher in my mirrors for most of the race
            increased the pressure and I made a good start
            although Eddie came flying past on the grass.&quot;</font></p>

            admit having a bit of an emotional moment was Jean
            Alesi when he won at Montreal in 1995. Last weekend
            however, after refusing to stop for fuel despite
            repeated requests by his team, it is likely that team
            boss <b>Flavio Briatore</b> will be shedding no tears
            for the contumacious Sicilian. Alesi said afterwards,
            &quot;I lost radio contact with the team and did not
            realise it was time for me to come into the pits for
            refueling.&quot; Some find it amazing that he managed
            to ignore the pit boards for three laps at least,
            whilst others, seeing him talking furiously into his
            helmet as a crawled to a stop, plainly believe that
            it was a pretty lame excuse for his impetuosity. The
            collective pit lane remains in silent vigil as they
            listen out for the whistle of the cane as it lands
            with measured severity on Alesi&#146;s backside.</font></p>

            <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Prost has a
            satisfying weekend</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Melbourne (9th March
            97)<b> Alain Prost</b> has expressed himself
            satisfied with the first race outing of the car
            bearing his own name after Olivier Panis finished
            fifth at Melbourne. From this base line, the team
            will be applying in Brazil the lessons learned in
            Australia and will be out testing at Silverstone next
            Monday and Tuesday. At Melbourne, Panis stopped twice
            and Nakano only once because the team expected the
            Japanese newcomer would be easier on his brakes than
            his faster and more experienced colleague. Prost
            said: &quot;This is the best thing that could have
            happened. It is going to boost everyone's confidence,
            especially <b>Bridgestone</b>'s who came away with
            their first Formula One points and <b>Mugen-Honda</b>
            who have worked very hard over the winter. Everyone
            has been rewarded by seeing both cars reach the
            finish. Only one other team can claim so much. As for
            me, it was a nerve-wracking experience following it
            all as team boss from the pit wall. I never found
            grands prix anything like so tense as this when I was
            a driver. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jackie Stewart</b>&#146;s
            debut grand prix was generally regarded as a success
            whilst neither driver finished the race, <b>Rubens
            Barrichello</b> having an engine failure and <b>Jan
            Magnussen</b> suffering suspension failure, they were
            however classified 10th and 11th. &quot;We didn't
            expect miracles,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;We've been
            around long enough to know you just can't wake up a
            giant and beat him up. The McLarens, the Williams,
            the Benettons, the Ferraris, etc., have been at it
            for a long time.&quot; He went on, &quot;I feel a
            mixture of joy, relief and disappointment. I feel
            emotional. It is quite different from racing and I
            have never felt like this in a car. I was thrilled
            with the team and thrilled when I saw the cars so
            close to the finish, especially Rubens. But the
            disappointment of him not finishing is much worse
            than anything I remember as a driver.&quot;
            Barrichello said after the race, &quot;The oil
            pressure warning light came on and I changed my
            driving style to see if I could nurse the car home,
            but we didn&#146;t quite make it. Running so well
            with both of us in the top 10 means we will get
            there.&quot;</font></p>

            was very disappointed with the team's performance in
            Australia and there is much work to complete before
            the Brazilian race. The biggest problem at Melbourne
            was getting the balance right on the softer compound <b>Goodyear</b>
            tyres which did not help their search for grip. The
            team will be attempting to rectify this at
            Silverstone next Monday and Tuesday. On Monday <b>Mika
            Salo</b> and test driver <b>Takagi </b>will drive and

            resulted in <b>Johnny Herbert</b>, Jacques Villeneuve
            and Irvine himself being put out of the race. The

            conflicted of course with Irvine denying any blame.
            &quot;I made a very good start and was alongside
            Coulthard at the first corner and then Villeneuve who
            moved over on me. I could have made the corner but I
            just needed the whole of the track.&quot; Villeneuve
            called Irvine's actions 'stupid' adding, &quot;Johnny
            was on the outside and I was on the inside and
            suddenly Eddie, who was on the dirty part of the
            track, was there. Next thing I knew we were both out.
            There was no way he could have turned in. Both Johnny
            and myself could have made the corner.&quot; Innocent
            party Johnny Herbert called him an 'idiot', but was
            philosophical later. &quot;...I saw this red thing
            behind him (Villeneuve). He was being rammed by
            Irvine. What&#146;s the point of being angry with
            Eddie? It&#146;s not worth it.&quot;</font></p>
