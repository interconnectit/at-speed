            face="Arial">Expectations were high for the <i>Tifosi</i>
            for qualifying at <b>Imola</b> today. With a
            favourable showing by the <b>Ferrari&#146;s</b> in
            the first timed session yesterday and notably <b>Eddie
            Irvine</b> finding that his excellent showing in <b>Argentina</b>
            was more than just a flash in the pan. However, with
            all the teams dressed for speed and carrying mere
            droplets of fuel to carry them little more than three
            laps at a time, again it turned into the <b><i>&#145;Williams
            show&#146;</i></b>. But, the fourth consecutive Pole
            position by the French Canadian <b>Jacques Villeneuve
            </b>was not as easily gained as it has been in the
            past. Team mate <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b>
            suffering the slings and arrows not only from the
            motoring press but from within his own team for his
            lack of speed and driving &#145;commitment&#146;
            performed his allotted task with aplomb, yet
            finishing the day three tenths of a second down. A
            country mile in Formula One, light years between two
            competing Williams&#146;. It was obvious that he was
            trying hard to find a way round the track and shave
            tenths of a second from his lap time. A vapor of
            smoke from his tyres, a miniscule flick of the rear,
            a haze of dirt from the edge of the track, he put
            everything into it but despite finding the fastest
            way round, Villeneuve came back to find an even
            faster one. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After his scathing
            remarks about F1 being <i>&#145;too safe&#146;</i>
            and<i> &#145;no fun&#146;,</i> it would have been an
            indictment of an apathetic participation in this
            event had he <i>not </i>taken pole position.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Michael Schumacher</b>&#146;s
            Ferrari put in the first real indication of future
            lap times with an early benchmark showing of 1.24.7,
            swapping the lead with Villeneuve in the first of
            four outings. Teammate Irvine, not seeming to be able
            to match the Ex Champion&#146;s pace today, was doing
            his best, but overdriving to the point of slowing his
            car down. A realistic man not prone to over self
            congratulation, said of his promising times
            yesterday, <i>&quot;One day you&#146;re a God, the
            next day a waste of space&quot;.</i> One
            wouldn&#146;t go quite so far as to think that, but a
            final 9th placing does not seem indicative of the
            Irishman&#146;s true potential.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The surprise of the
            day was the performance put in by the two <b>Jordan
            Peugeot</b> drivers <b>Ralf Schumacher </b>and<b>
            Giancarlo Fisichella</b>. In a seemingly internal
            battle for position within the team as much as on the
            grid, the two arch enemies (for that is what they
            seem to have become after their unfortunate coming
            together in Argentina) did all they could to outpace
            each other. This time though, working to great effect
            for the team and leaving them with a third row lock
            out sitting pretty behind only the Williams&#146;, a
            Ferrari and the <b>Prost Mugen-Honda</b> of <b>Olivier
            Panis</b>. <i>&quot;I am cross with myself for making
            a mistake in the first chicane when I was on my third
            run on the first set of tyres,&quot; </i>said the
            young Schumacher afterwards, <i>&quot;but we should
            win points tomorrow and with luck, perhaps make the
            podium again.&quot;</i> Hardly humble words there and
            in contrast to Fisichella, who commented, <i>&quot;Of
            course I would love to finish in Italy on the Podium,
            but winning points is the main thing.&quot;</i> The
            chances of a home win for the Italian however richly
            deserved, must be zero.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We have come to expect
            a great deal from Panis and it was therefore no
            surprise that he finished an excellent 4th, highest
            of the <b>Bridgestone</b> runners. With a <b>Peugeot </b>engine
            next year and the continued development of the
            chassis, Panis could find himself inside the top
            three drivers by the end of next season. Unlike
            fellow Frenchman <b>Jean Alesi,</b> who yet again
            blotted his already disgustingly splattered copy book
            by over-braking on the downhill bend at <b><i>Rivazza</i></b>
            and rear-ending himself in the dirt. It will be the
            greatest of surprises to see him driving for Benetton
            next year, if indeed he gets a drive at all.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The luckless <b>Damon
            Hill</b> retired half way through the session coming
            to a standstill on a grass verge. Having had testing
            delayed by HM Customs &amp; Excise when they
            impounded his car for a day on its return from
            Argentina, he suffered throttle actuator problems in
            yesterday&#146;s timed practice session and was today
            unable to use the spare as it was set up for teammate
            <b>Pedro Diniz</b> who, with a following wind,
            managed an electrifying 17th. Forever cheerful, Hill
            refused to make a meal of his misfortunes. <i>&quot;There&#146;s
            not much to say. We did the best we could and 15th is
            not a great result.&quot;</i> Promising (as they all
            do) to do better in the race, he came out with one of
            those diplomatic understatements that has earned him
            the respect of the pit lane and a reputation as the
            sport&#146;s most level-headed politician. <i>&quot;We
            need more horsepower.&quot;</i> It could have been
            the modern day Shakespearean equivalent of King
            Henry&#146;s cry of desperation from the fields of
            Agincourt, <i>&quot;A horse! A horse! My Kingdom for
            a horse!&quot; </i>but echoed from the<i> </i>back of
            the grid to the great engine supplier in the sky. It
            could also have been a stinging condemnation of
            broken promises of fulfillment by the Arrows team,
            but it was neither. <i>&quot;We must press on!&quot;</i>
            he said finally, like a fell-walker stopping for a
            quick swig of Lucozade before striding to the summit.
            In the face of adversity Hill certainly is one of the
            best.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another driver forced
            to use his spare car and managing a meagre 13th place
            after such a great showing in Argentina was <b>Stewart
            Ford</b> driver <b>Rubens Barichello</b>. Running a
            revised &#145;Project 6&#146; version of the <b>Ford
            Cosworth</b>, both race cars suffered high speed
            misfires and consequently the older &#145;Project
            5&#146; set the time for both drivers, <b>Jan
            Magnussen</b> slotting in 3 places behind. <i>&quot;This
            was ...the first time I had to cope with engine
            problems,&quot;</i> said a disappointed Barichello. <i>&quot;It
            started to show up by the end of free practice, but
            we took the risk of continuing with that engine.
            Obviously in the spare, both the engine and the
            brakes were different and I think the time we
            achieved was the maximum I could have expected.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the session
            closing, the top three were out in force all
            confirming, but not changing, the final position set
            earlier. Schumacher&#146;s last mad dash was all
            smoke and rear end wiggle and as the chequered flag
            fell, <b>Johnny Herbert&#146;s</b> <b>Sauber Petronas
            </b>slipped by and up a place to finish 7th pushing
            the <b>McLaren Mercedes</b> of <b>Mika Hakkinen</b>
            down to 8th. With <b>David Coulthard</b> 10th behind
            Irvine&#146;s Ferrari it wasn&#146;t a good day for
            the McLarens, and it seems incredible that he drove
            the same car to victory in Melbourne in the
            season&#146;s opener. Coulthard will probably say
            that &#145;it&#146;s <i>not</i> the same car!&#146;
            but it still remains a mystery as to why the McLarens
            blow hot and cold with such regularity.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Revised front
            suspension for <b>Gerhard Berger</b> failed to keep
            the front end of his <b>Benetton Renault</b> on the
            track preventing his soft <b>Goodyear</b> tyres from
            generating the heat required, despite an extremely
            &#145;grippy&#146; track.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jarno Trulli</b>
            -my tip for greatness in the next century- had a car
            with no power. People will say, &quot;But of course,
            it&#146;s a <b>Minardi</b>!&quot; This is not the
            case and the Minardi has this year so far, been
            within very respectable parameters of averaged lap
            times, due to a large extent, to the talents of this
            young rookie.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Failure by both
            Villeneuve and Frentzen to obey yellow flags
            following an incident towards the end of the
            qualifying session, resulted in a one race suspended
            ban for both drivers.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lets hope Villeneuve
            will be pushed to the ragged edge tomorrow and, if
            Frentzen can maintain his composure under pressure
            situations, the &#145;God&#146; that Irvine talked
            about and, maybe currently sitting between the
            Canadian&#146;s ears, just might be rocked on his
            throne.</font></p>
