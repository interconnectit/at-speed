        size="2" face="Arial">nce in a while, it is a little
        unnerving to see such a blatant squandering of money on
        an event that, in the eyes of some other teams well
        enough able to flash their fat wads of Sponsorship wedge,
        appear a touch shall we say, &#145;over the top&#146;,
        proving that, like &#145;the Movies&#146; and Rock
        &#145;n&#146; Roll, the circus, commonly known as Formula
        1, is just another branch of show business. You&#146;ll
        probably be told by Circus ringmaster <b>Bernie
        Ecclestone</b> and even McLaren Team Boss <b>Ron</b> <b>Dennis</b>,
        that this has always been the case ever since a Mr <b>Colin
        Chapman</b> struck a deal with Players cigarettes, and
        painted red and gold stripes down the side of his car,
        forever sealing National identities and Grand Marques
        under a multicoloured sea of tobacco, alcohol and
        petroleum logos.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
        financial disbursement on the part of companies eager to
        become associated with what was then, and indeed still is
        now, a glamourous white-collar spectator sport, has of
        course allowed Formula 1 to reach stratospheric heights
        of technological advancement. The canvas deckchairs on
        the airfields of a summertime England have been replaced
        with ubiquitous air-conditioned Motor Homes the size of
        tennis courts and the handlebar moustaches have long
        since disappeared, along with wire wheels and goggles.
        This is no bad thing when you consider the fact that you
        can sit bleary-eyed in front of your television at 4.30
        am and watch a <b>Grand Prix</b> live from an amusement
        park some 12,000 miles away. To support Formula one in
        the style it (and &#145;we&#146;) has become accustomed,
        someone has to pay. The consumer in the final analysis
        will always foot the bill, yet motor racing proves a case
        in point that we <i>can </i>&#145;have our cake, and eat
        it &#145;.</font></p>

        src="spices.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="200"
        height="149"></font><font size="2" face="Arial">So, with
        the Gold, Silver and Bronze <b>VIP</b> passes , the
        sipping of Champagne with the stars, complimentary
        cigarettes and lighters and all the media attention they
        could want, the newly styled <b>Team West Mclaren
        Mercedes </b>consummated their marriage to new major
        German sponsor <b>West Cigarettes </b>in front of an
        invited audience of almost five thousand fans at the
        cavernous <b>Alexandra Palace</b> in London. Fans, that
        is, of the <b>Spice Girls</b> who in suitably raunchy
        attire strutted their equipment in front of West McLaren
        Mercedes&#146; own equipment, which was swathed in blue
        laser light behind them. The car enthusiasts were there
        of course, members of the McLaren fan club. You could
        recognise them, because they were not dressed up as Spice
        Girl clones.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Indeed, the perennially
        popular &#145;voice of launch control&#146;, <b>Steve
        Rider</b>, was on hand to ensure that, &#145;West McLaren
        Mercedes cannot be ignored during the season to
        come.&#146; and that &#145;This was the livery that would
        identify and characterize the team well into the next
        century&#146;. The aforementioned wedding between West
        and Mclaren was announced at the car&#146;s unofficial
        launch last month when it appeared in an orange
        &#145;testing&#146; livery reminiscent of the early days
        of McLaren. As whirling rollerskaters, attired in the
        &#145;new look&#146; McLaren pit overalls, performed fast
        figures of eight under a billowing canopy of silver silk,
        the car emerged from the smoke and a shower of laser
        beams. It was indeed an impressive moment as the car
        revolved slowly, angled to the audience to reveal every
        intimate facet in all its splendour.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
        src="ml97laab.jpg" width="320" height="212"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Six multi-national graphic
        design companies were provided with a well defined brief
        to create the new team livery. The winning concept came
        from the London based design company <b>Fitch</b>, and
        was then optimised in partnership with McLarens own
        in-house graphics team. The rumours of the &#145;Silver
        Arrows&#146; was partly proved correct with the chassis
        carrying the traditional Mercedes colour and the sidepods
        were given to the black and white of the West logo.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After enjoying a brief
        period as the most successful team in motor racing with
        104 race wins, McLaren lost their way with three barren
        seasons that saw a change of engine supplier from Peugeot
        to Mercedes and the signing of Scotsman <b>David
        Coulthard</b> in 1996 to sit alongside Finn, <b>Mika
        Hakkinen</b>. <b>Jean Alesi</b> driving a <b>Ferrari</b>
        went and spoiled things for them by winning in Montreal
        in 1995 and <b>Michael Schumacher</b>, adding three more
        in &#146;96, dropped them back down to second place.
        Three seasons without a win must sit very uncomfortably
        on Ron Dennis&#146; shoulders. As he said at the
        unofficial launch last month, &quot;(I am) making a
        conscious effort to play down my own expectations.
        I&#146;m not going to make any predictions about the
        success of the car..&quot; The car itself reflects the
        all out effort that designer <b>Neil Oatley</b> and his
        team have put into it. As with The new <b>Jordan Peugeot</b>,
        major redesigning has taken place. Both teams likewise
        are aware that their engine suppliers are looking for
        exceptional results and another unsuccessful season could
        jeopardize their chances of retaining engine supplies in
        the future. Mclaren&#146;s recent tie-in with <b>British
        Aerospace</b> has guaranteed them the use of one of the
        finest wind tunnels in the world and has undoubtedly had
        an important effect on the look of the new car.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
        src="ml97laac.jpg" width="350" height="191"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As reported earlier on <b>Speed
        Motorsport News</b>, in line with the updated FIA
        technical regulations, the MP4-12 features a rear impact
        zone, collapsible steering column, reduced winglets areas
        and suspension designed within the limited aspect ratios
        designated by the technical regulations. The nose too, is
        unfashionably, 20mm lower than last years car. A newly
        packaged version of the longitudinal transmission
        introduced in 1996 will be in place for a second season
        and the cooling system has also been re-designed to
        capitalise on internal air flow.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Successful testing has
        already taken place at both the <b>Jerez</b> and <b>Estoril</b>
        circuits and results certainly bode well for the season.
        Amid a frenzied throng of reporters at the
        &#145;informal&#146; press conference after the show,
        Coulthard said, &#145;We haven&#146;t tested against <b>Benetton
        </b>but we are faster than Ferrari at the moment.&#146;
        Asked about the current Constructors&#146; Champion, he
        echoed most of the teams sentiments in stating that,
        &#145;Conservative money says that <b>Williams</b> will
        be the main force.&#146; This is not doubted by many and
        judging from the rush to &#145;re-evolve&#146; current
        models rather more drastically than last year despite
        protestations to the contrary, there could be more of a
        haggle for the podium steps than we have seen in recent
        years.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="ml97laad.jpg" width="300"
        height="221"></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the relative peace and
        quiet of the <b>West Hall </b>with the silent images on
        giant video screens, of the Spice Girls strutting their
        stuff for the fans, Messrs Coulthard and Hakkinen pulled
        the silver sheet from a second car for the benefit of
        photographers. It was as expected, exquisitely turned
        out, and it did indeed look rather beautiful and full of
        purpose. However, all this ballyhoo and razzmatazz will
        not make the car any more mercurial and it remains to be
        seen how they fare on the track. Confidence and bravado
        were present in huge quantities and if teams like McLaren
        and Jordan Peugeot have got their act together as it
        seems they have, then Frank Williams will be given a run
        for his money that has been a long time coming. </font></p>
