            that's the case at this show. For most race car
            manufacturers this show is their opportunity to show
            off their latest creations. Not only that, but many
            of the component manufacturers like to show that they've
            been busy too.</font></p>

            face="Arial">Subaru, who's cars are prepared by
            Prodrive, were another team to show off their latest
            and most gorgeous. Their latest World Rally
            Championship contender looked great, but here's a tip
            to Subaru... Clean the car! In fact, anyone used to
            the extremely high standards of presentation that's present
            at International car shows would find that the motorsport
            lot are rather more interested in how their cars go,
            than how they look. That's all good and proper, and
            to be quite honest most race cars never look as good
            as they did here!</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
            face="Arial">Another notable highlight was Noel
            Edmonds' launch of the new Panoz GT racer. Panoz is
            an American small capacity production car
            manufacturer who specialise in high performance,
            large capacity motorcars for the enthusiast customer.
            The cars themselves could be described as gorgeously
            brutalistic in their looks, as you an see in the picture
            of the new GT below, but others seemed to think it was
            just plain ugly. If you want to see a Panoz GT in
            real action then go along to this year's Le Mans
            24hour race in June where Noel Edmonds' Unique Sport
            will be racing the GT1 racer. If you'd like one of
            these cars you'll need to pay a whopping $750,000!
            McLaren F1 money, and it's electronically governed to
            a maximum top speed of 155mph. A more affordable
            Panoz AIV Roadster will still go like stink and costs
            just $58,000 - a snip in comparison, though I couldn't
            help feeling that most British and European customers
            would favour a Caterham Superlight for less money and
            a purer design basis.<br>

            face="Arial">Engine manufacturers and tuners were out
            in force. Whether you need a rally version of the
            Subaru flat four engine or a 'Superchip' fitted to
            your Escort you'll find what you need to know at the
            show. Some of the more interesting stands were being
            run by manufacturers such as Cosworth, Champion, and
            Renault. If, however, your interest happens to lie in
            tuning then you could find technicians from Cosworth,
            Superchips, Demon Tweeks, or Janspeed.<img

            show was quite simply incredible. Electric karts specialists
            through to hose suppliers through to livery designers through
            to Formula One. Interestingly, none of the top
            Formula One teams had stands of their own. To make up
            for it Goodyear and Bridgestone F1 tyre makers both
            had huge and impressive stands to draw your
            attention.</font></p>
