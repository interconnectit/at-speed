            size="2" face="Arial"><b>Mika Hakkinen</b> was
            cruelly denied the first pole position of his career
            in the closing minute of the qualifying session at
            the <i>A!-Ring</i> in Austria today by a blistering
            and aggressive lap from <b>Williams</b> driver <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b>. Where starting positions is an all
            important step to the final outcome of the race, the
            Canadian has put himself in the strongest possible
            position for a much needed race win if he is to offer
            any competition at all to current leader <b>Michael
            Schumacher </b>who struggled to a lowly 9th place
            behind team mate <b>Eddie Irvine</b>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For the first 25
            minutes there was nothing to spoil the view of the
            rolling hills and distant mountains of the Tyrol
            under a fine mottled blue sky. Certainly not any cars
            marred the scene, with the exception of <b>Tarso
            Marques</b>&#146; Minardi and <b>Jos Verstappen</b>&#146;s
            <b>Tyrrell</b> who did the early work of laying down
            the first layer of rubber on a track that lacks any
            grip. With only two runs expected from the teams and
            after a prolonged and rather eerie silence, an
            increasingly frustrated crowd eventually saw track
            action get underway with barely half the session
            remaining.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Bridgestone</b>
            tyres seem well suited to the nature of the <em>&#145;stop
            and go&#146; </em>circuit and throughout the weekend
            the Japanese tyres have been running close to the
            front of the pack. The <b>Goodyear</b> soft option
            was not the choice of the teams today. Still
            blistering within 4 or 5 laps in warm weather, harder
            compounds were favoured by the majority and, whilst
            not giving high qualifying positions, they are
            considered a less compromising bet for the race. Only
            <b>Ferrari</b>&#146;s Eddie Irvine and <b>Sauber</b>
            opted for the softer tyres possibly gambling on a
            cooler track temperature for the race, yet all the
            Bridgestone runners seemed to be able to make up for
            their lack of speed by running with the softer and
            more durable rubber, dividing the first six places
            evenly between both manufacturers.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first solid times
            were set by <b>Stewart</b> drivers <b>Jan Magnussen</b>
            and <b>Rubens Barichello</b> who continued to trade
            personal bests for the rest of the session in their
            best showing to date, the newly modified Ford V10
            showing drastic improv3ment over recent outings.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jarno Trulli</b>&#146;s
            <b>Mugen-Honda</b> gave out in a big way at turn 6 <i>(A1
            Kurve) </i>leaving a trail of oil all the way to the
            pits to the great displeasure of all who followed in
            his wake. Indeed Magnussen under a great deal of
            pressure from his Boss <b>Jackie Stewart </b>to
            improve his overall performance thought that he was
            capable of better times. <i>&quot;My hopes were
            really high,&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;but first
            Trulli put oil down in front of me, then when I did a
            long run at the end of the session I got caught
            behind a Minardi when I was on a quick lap.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This was indeed the
            case for all the drivers who all exited the pits in a
            scrum as if a whistle had blown and at one point
            there were17 cars on the track at the same time all
            trying to find clear space for a quick run. Heinz
            Harald Frentzen remained in the pit lane with a
            jammed gear and was hard pushed at the end of the
            session to improve his time from DNQ to 4th place. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <b>McLaren</b>s
            again proving their inexplicable disparity, blew hot
            and cold. Hot for Hakinnen who hung on to his
            provisional pole until the very last moments and most
            definitely cold for<b> David Coulthard</b> who was
            close to being a back marker until he managed to
            screw a few more revs from the <b>Mercedes</b> to
            place him 10th</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Gerhard Berger</b>
            struggled all through the session, the <b>Benetton</b>s
            not running at all well. <i>&quot;I am not happy with
            this poor result.&quot;</i> Said Berger. <i>&quot;We
            have worked hard all weekend, but did not manage to
            get the best from the car. We chose hard tyres and we
            just weren&#146;t able to get a quick lap. Down from
            18th position, it will be a real challenge to get
            some points.&quot;</i> <b>Jean Alesi</b> likewise
            suffering in a team that is undergoing a small crisis
            at the moment with a management take-over and their
            showing so far. <i>&quot;The balance of the car
            seemed good, but I did not seem to be able to get the
            grip which is needed.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;We
            have to try and understand the problem and see what
            we can do before tomorrow.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The<b> Jordan Peugeot</b>
            team uncharacteristically, were well down the field <b>Schumacher</b>
            Junior finishing ahead of team mate <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b>, normally a front runner these days,
            in 11th. Neither driver was able to make their car
            perform to recent standards. <i>&quot;I am not really
            surprised at out poor results today.&quot; Said
            Schumacher. We have not really been on good form all
            weekend and are suffering from a lack of grip. The
            only real problems were understeer in the fourth
            corner and nervousness in the rear when I try to
            accelerate in the mid-corners.&quot;</i> No such
            complaints from Fisichella however, who just
            complained about the traffic. <i>&quot;The real
            problem for me though was traffic and I was really
            held up by Sauber and by </i><b><i>Michael Schumacher</i></b><i>.&quot;</i>
            To say that you were held up by the best driver on
            the planet is indicative of how slow the<b> Ferrari</b>&#146;s
            were and for the two time world champion to finish a
            slot adrift of his team mate proves that the Ferrari
            is definitely not at home in Austria.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Damon Hill</b> ran
            well setting quick times on his first outing to put
            him in 3rd slot but with increasing traffic and a
            quicker track he was unlucky not to get any higher
            and was slowly pushed down the grid by fast times
            from Villeneuve, Frentzen and a brilliant last minute
            dive from <b>Jarno Trulli </b>in the spare <b>Prost</b>,
            to take a surprising 3rd place. Hill, trying too
            hard, ended up in the gravel on his last quick lap, 5
            minutes before the flag fell</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With less than a
            second separating the top 14 places and five of those
            on <b>Bridgestone </b>rubber, tomorrow&#146;s race
            will certainly be unpredictable. Lack of overtaking
            opportunities will put the onus on the tyres to
            perform, perhaps beyond their limits and on a track
            that lacks grip but forces the driver to run with
            less downforce than he would like to enable him to
            get through the corners without stopping, the mid
            field could have it&#146;s day.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Williams</b>
            however, look set to dominate but not without some
            intervention from the likes of <b>Stewart </b>and <b>McLaren</b>.
            What is important, is that Schumacher&#146;s <b>Ferrari</b>
            lies 8 places behind Villeneuve&#146;s Williams. It
            will take a superhuman effort from the German to make
            up that kind of deficit at the start especially with
            wizzmaster Coulthard right beside him. The start will
            be crucial to any number of drivers and could set the
            seal for an interesting race of tactics, in as much
            as the leading protagonists could be those that
            don&#146;t usually see so much of the limelight.</font></p>
