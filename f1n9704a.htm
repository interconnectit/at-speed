            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Michael Schumacher</b>
            completed the <b>Ferrari</b> tests at the <b>Mugello</b>
            (Italy) circuit today. The German carried out a grand
            prix simulation in an <b>F 310 B</b> fitted with the <b>046/2</b>
            engine. The test, divided into three runs was stopped
            just three laps short of the planned race distance
            with a hydraulic leak. In the morning, the team
            worked on a few set- up changes. Schumacher covered a
            total of 87 laps (approximately 456 kilometres) with
            a best time of 1m 25.25s, which is a new record for
            the Tuscany circuit, despite the fact he was not
            running in qualifying trim. During the test he tried
            both soft and hard compound Goodyear tyres. <i>&quot;This
            was a good day. I am satisfied with the 046/2 engine,
            both in terms of its reliability and drive-ability.
            We are making major progress,&quot;</i> Schumacher
            said after the tests.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Ferrari team have
            also denied the claims made by Italian sports daily <b><i>Tuttosport</i></b>,
            that <b>Eddie Irvine</b> is about to get fired and
            replaced by <b>Gianni Morbidelli</b> if he doesn't do
            well during the next Grand Prix in Argentina. A
            spokesman said: <i>&quot;Ferrari have every
            confidence in Eddie Irvine.&quot; </i>He added: <i>&quot;It
            is premature to talk about any changes, although it's
            obvious that every driver must give his best and
            contribute to the race tactics decided by those in
            charge of the team.&quot;</i></font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After finishing sixth
            at Interlagos, <b>Jean Alesi</b> was at <b>Silverstone</b>
            on Wednesday and Thursday driving the <b>Benetton
            B197</b> test car preparing new front suspension
            geometry for the Argentine GP. <i>&quot;We were very
            happy with the way the test went,&quot;</i> said <b>Nick
            Wirth</b>, the team's new chief designer. <i>&quot;We
            had a successful race with both cars in Brazil and we
            are looking forward to challenging for the lead again
            in Buenos Aires.&quot;</i> It was Alesi's first visit
            to Silverstone since its corners were re-profiled and
            the circuit resurfaced. He quickly adapted to the
            changes and was encouraged by the test, completing 21
            timed laps with a best of 1m 22.94s.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b> returned to England from Brazil to
            shake down the fourth Jordan 197 at Silverstone on
            Thursday. The chassis will be introduced into the
            team as Fisichella's race chassis at <b>Imola</b>,
            allowing his existing car to become the team spare
            while the current spare will become the permanent
            test car. Fisichella completed 38 timed laps with a
            best time of 1m 25.05s, trying new electronics and an
            updated differential. Technical director <b>Gary
            Anderson</b> explained that Fisichella was also
            testing some minor components in preparation for the
            Buenos Aires race. <i>&quot;We have to get the best
            out of certain bits and pieces on the car and this
            test will help,&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;I think
            the cars proved quick enough in Brazil, but if you
            are stuck down in ninth place, there isn't much the
            drivers can do.&quot;</i></font></p>

            Grand Prix review, <b>Paul Stewart</b> explains that
            Barrichello's startline problem at Interlagos was due
            to an electrical software problem with the
            drive-by-wire system. <i>&quot;On the grid, the
            engine suddenly shot up to 16,000rpm and
            automatically shut down,&quot; </i>he explained.<i>

            <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Frentzen up before
            the beak.</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Heinz-Harald
            Frentzen </b>was due to visit the Williams
            headquarters today (Friday) to have a detailed
            de-brief on his disappointing run to ninth place in
            the Brazilian GP. After colliding with Giancarlo
            Fisichella in the first start to the race, he had no
            choice but to race in the spare car, but he never
            looked able to compete with the front-runners. <i>&quot;It
            will all take a bit longer,&quot;</i> said Frentzen, <i>&quot;At
            Sauber, it was different and I had my own way of
            setting up my car, but I haven't been able to do it
            properly at Williams yet. Here, I&#146;m the new guy
            and have to work Damon's way, with a team that takes
            its own options. In any case, I don't think that I'm
            getting the best out of my car.&quot;</i> Gerhard
            Berger would agree that a faulty damper that Frentzen
            had during the race could have harmed his lap times.
            Damon Hill, replaced by Frentzen this season however,
            <i>already</i> driving his spare Arrows car due to a
            Fuel leak in the race car <i>and</i> compromised by a
            gear shift problem, matched the German&#146;s pace
            for most of the race, with equipment hardly up to the
            Williams spec. Whilst <b>Frank Williams</b> might
            think that it could take Frentzen half the season to
            match his team mate, it is doubtful that the
            Boss&#146;s patience will last that long. Frentzen
            has already canceled plans for a vacation after
            Brazil and his audience with Williams. His excuse
            could be that<b> Jacques Villeneuve</b> had 6000 kms
            under his belt this time last year, but then
            Villeneuve had not sat in an F1 car before. Frentzen
            had three years at Sauber to get his Formula 1
            awareness together. <i>&quot;What will really boost
            Heinz-Harald's confidence is having a decent run in
            Argentina,&quot;</i> said technical director <b>Patrick
            Head</b>, ever the diplomat. <i>&quot;He wasn't the
            only driver to have a poor weekend in Brazil, so we
            must just get to the bottom of his problem and
            correct the situation.&quot;</i></font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <b>Tyrrell Racing
            Organisation</b> is satisfied that both cars finished
            the Brazilian GP, but disappointed about their
            mediocre placings. <i>&quot;We have reliability, now
            we must look to the performance,&quot;</i> said Ken
            Tyrrell. In order to do just that, Chief Designer <b>Harvey
            Postlethwaite</b> is back in Britain working on
            modifications to use on the cars in Argentina. A new
            specification Ford V8 engine is expected for the <b>San

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>March 29th
            Interlagos.</i> The blue covers stayed on the cars in
            the Lola team pit garages this weekend. It seems now
            that they will never roll again. A spokesman for the
            company said in a short statement, <i>&quot;the Lola
            organization is experiencing financial difficulties
            and, as a result Lola Formula 1 would not be able to
            continue its 1997 racing season and as a consequence
            of that, Mastercard sponsorship of Lola Formula 1 has
            ended.&quot;</i> Team Boss Eric Broadley stated that
            &#145;funding was nor forthcoming&#146;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a complex
            sponsorship deal with the Brazilian arm of Mastercard
            funding was to be provided from a &#145;Lola
            Mastercard holders Club&#146;. This would bring money
            to the team by mid season. It seemed however that
            there was some confusion as to who would bridge the
            gap until this cash came on-stream. Mastercard was
            said to have assumed that Lola had &#145;funds
            already raised&#146; and that it&#146;s sponsorship
            deal was &#145;on top&#146; of Lola&#146;s budget.
            Lola it was said hoped to survive until mid season on
            the cash already delivered (approx £200,000), its
            smaller sponsor Penzoil, and Lola itself.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It says something for
            the wisdom of Broadley to pull out now rather than to
            go on digging himself further into financial debt and
            jeopardising the other sporting arm of Lola Cars
            which looks, for the immediate future to be
            unaffected by the crisis <i>&quot; We have delivered
            $12 million of equipment to the US and we will
            continue to supply chassis elsewhere.&quot;</i> Said
            a spokesman for Lola. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lola&#146;s Engine
            development programme was not totally funded by them
            and is now seen as a separate entity<i>(see separate
            engine story).</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite attempts to
            raise further funding it is widely assumed that Lola
            will quit Formula 1 at least for this year. Broadley
            said, <i>&quot;I won&#146;t say Lola will not return
            to GP racing in the future. F1 is the Pinnacle of the
            sport and we have vowed to participate in it.&quot;</i></font></p>

            different from that of the European races. Renault
            Sports Race Team Manager, Jean-Francois Robin
            explains:</b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>How do you organise
            yourselves for the two consecutive Grands Prix on the
            South American continent?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jean-François Robin:
            &quot;Because of the distances involved, the South
            American campaign follows the same overall planning
            strategy as that employed for the Australian Grand
            Prix. Being so far away from base for two races in
            succession does however accentuate the unknown factor
            which faces us in the early part of the season, and
            that is that we are unable to confirm the total
            reliability of our engines following inspection of
            the units used for the opening race.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;After each Grand
            Prix, Renault Sport's priority is to recuperate the
            engines from the previous race as quickly as possible
            in order to strip and inspect them, a procedure which
            is essential if the engine is to evolve. The
            principal difference with long haul events compared
            to a European Grand Prix resides in the time it takes
            to get the engines back to Viry-Châtillon. Generally
            we are able to work on them on the Wednesday after a
            race, but this clearly isn't the case for the South
            American rounds.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The distances
            involved when traveling to Brazil and Argentina do
            not leave us with sufficient turnaround time and
            that, it has to be said, is effectively something of
            an inconvenience.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>What does this mean
            in concrete terms?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jean-François Robin:
            &quot;In concrete terms, we are obliged to prepare
            the qualifying and race engines for Brazil and the
            qualifying engines for Argentina at the same time.
            These are built to exactly the same specification
            since we do not have time to react between the two
            Grands Prix. These engines are sent together to Sao
            Paulo.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The race engines
            for Argentina however follow our normal methodology
            and are shipped directly from France to Argentina. We
            will have had sufficient time to incorporate any fine
            tuning adjustments judged necessary following
            inspection of the components that come back from
            Australia. It is not vital for the Argentina race
            engines to be in Buenos Aires on the Monday preceding
            the race - as is the case with the qualifying engines
            - and we therefore have time to carry out any
            modifications we believe necessary.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;From the
            logistical point of view, our total running stock of
            engines - that is to say, 20 per team- has been built
            up by the time the South American campaign comes
            around. This means that our entire stock of engines
            is physically away from the Factory for the seasons
            first three races.&quot;</font></p>

            &quot;The major unknown factor of the season is the
            tyres. Being able to choose from two types of rubber
            for each Grand Prix is going to be very important
            tactically and changes in weather conditions are
            likely to complicate matters further still.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The new V10 is

            the A12 but there are practically no parts that have
            been carried over from it. The A14 is smaller,
            lighter and more compact than its predecessor.&quot; </font></p>

            presenting the A14 engine as its first real
            three-litre design. Is that how you would describe
            it?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The earlier A10
            and A12 designs were both derived from the 3.5-litre
            engine of 1994. They had the same architecture and
            were fundamentally the same. We didn't want to build
            a pure three-litre engine any earlier because we
            wanted to apply the experience we gained with the A6,
            rather than making big changes to the layout of the
            engine prematurely, before we had sufficient
            experience with this kind of engine. Developing a new
            engine takes a relatively long time and we preferred
            to take our time to introduce the A14 for 1997 rather
            than rush it out for last year and risk problems with
            reliability. At Peugeot Sport reliability is close to
            our hearts - as much as finding more horsepower - and
            I think we were right to use the A12, which was
            derived from the A10 - last year.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>What have you
            incorporated in the A14 which you reamed from your
            previous engines?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The A14 is still
            a V10 with the same 72-degree v-angle. Fundamentally
            it works in the same way as the A12 did. What we did
            was to look at ways of making every piece of the
            engine smaller and lighter with the lowest possible
            frictional losses. We have, if you like, pushed ahead
            with the development which we did on the A10 and A12
            engines.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>How many parts of
            the A14 are the same as in the A12?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;There aren't
            many. At most I would say a dozen.&quot; You talk
            about the engine being lighter and having gained a
            few centimetres here are there, to the casual
            observer, the figures don't seem to be very big.
            &quot;Our engine has dropped from 135 to 127 kgs.
            That means we have gained eight kilos. That is quite
            a lot. At this level it really is not easy to reduce
            weight. When you build an engine which weighs 150kgs
            it is easy to find a way to save five kilos but after
            that it gets more and more difficult to save weight
            without affecting the reliability of the engine.
            Making a lighter engine means that one can improve
            the weight distribution of the car to improve the
            handling, which is also helped by the fact that we
            have managed to lower the centre of gravity of the
            engine by some centimetres. A smaller engine also
            allows all the engine ancillaries to be arranged to
            improve the weight distribution.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>When you began
            working on the design of the A14 engine, how much did
            you know about the design of the 1997 Jordan? </b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We didn't know
            anything at all about the car, but we did know the
            objectives which we had defined with Jordan engineers
            in our development plan. We worked along the lines
            laid down in this plan.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The big word at
            Peugeot Sport last year was &quot;reliability&quot;
            what is this year's catchphrase?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In the course of
            the 1997 season we want to show that the A14 engine
            is as reliable as the A12 was and, if possible,
            better because we have two failures with the A12.
            That may be not be many but for us it is not good
            enough. Having said that we do not know the A14 as
            well as we knew its predecessor and we have obviously
            taken a calculated technical risk in introducing the
            new engine this year. We are satisfied with the
            performance-and the weight but we have to improve the
            reliability. We can only do that as we go along in
            the course of the season.&quot; <i>As far as this
            year's A14 engine is concerned we have reached all
            the targets which we had planned for with
            Jordan.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;As far as we are
            concerned this is not really the principal goal. It
            is only one of them. The aerodynamic set-up of the
            cars at the moment means that it is not easy to
            exploit all the available power in all situations
            Clearly in terms of acceleration from tight comers we
            don't know how to use all the available horsepower.
            We know how to use the horsepower when the car is
            accelerating at high speed in a straight line. Using
            horsepower at the top of the rev ranges is not
            difficult, the skill is to find smooth delivery of
            power at low speeds and in the medium rev ranges so
            that it is always power available when a driver needs
            to use it.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Do you think it is
            a handicap to have to work with two young and
            inexperienced drivers - Ralf Schumacher and Giancarlo
            Fisichella?</b> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;If there is a
            handicap, it is in the development of the chassis.</i>
            As far as the engine is concerned we are in our
            fourth season in F1 and we are beginning to profit
            from a certain amount of experience in setting-up our
            engines. The youth of the two Jordan drivers ought
            not to be a handicap to us during the 1997
            season.&quot;</font></p>

            News...</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Reports that <b>Benetton</b>
            team boss <b>Flavio Briatore</b> has sealed a two
            year deal to use <b>Mecachrome</b> prepared <b>Renault</b>
            engines have yet to be substantiated but it looks
            more than likely and Briatore is expected to make an
            announcement in the next week or so. The expected
            cost of over £10 million a year is likely to be
            funded in part by the extra money provided by the
            increased TV revenue the teams will receive from a
            revised structuring of the <b>Concord Agreement</b>.
            For Briatore to consider a deal with <b>Mugen Honda</b>,
            it is thought that he would want the parent company
            of the Japanese engine supplier to become fully
            involved by the &#146;99 season. Favourites for the
            second batch of engines after Prost, is Jordan who
            seem unlikely to retain their links with Peugeot in
            view of their poor showings at the first two Grands
            Prix this year. Whether Mugen Honda would want Jordan
            however, is another matter as repeated promises, as
            yet unfulfilled, that the team will break into the
            top five next year are beginning to wear thin.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Shinji Nakano</b>,
            current Prost No 2 driver is to marry the daughter of
            Mugen's Chairman, <b>Hirotoshi Honda</b>. Nepotism,
            it seems sits beside Formula 1 well. It will indeed
            be hard for <b>Alain Prost</b> to even think about
            taking on the errant <b>Jean Alesi </b>next season.
            To do this Nakano would have to go elsewhere. Perhaps
            to Benetton next year in a sort of musical chairs?
            This could of course throw a spanner in the works
            regarding Briatore&#146;s above mentioned deal with
            Renault. But it is widely rumoured that Flavio is not
            interested in taking the rookie Japanese and Honda
            are extremely keen naturally, to see him placed in
            front of one of their engines.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The possibility that <b>TWR</b>
            may be in line for the Honda would make sense as it
            would also with Renault. Both manufactures recognise <b>Damon
            Hill</b>&#146;s proven development capabilities.
            Mugen are also familiar with most the TWR engineers
            who worked with the Ligier team before moving with
            then team boss <b>Tom Walkinshaw</b> to form the
            revamped Arrows outfit. There must also be a clause
            in Walkinshaw&#146;s contract that stipulates Hill
            staying on for a further two years to realise the
            engine&#146;s potential. Hill is currently half way
            through his one-year deal with TWR. The revised <b>Yamaha</b>
            engine is not now expected until the Spanish Grand
            Prix, and could even be later, requiring some
            fundamental redesigning of the <b>Arrows A18</b>
            chassis.</font></p>

            continued into the Brazilian's fatal crash at the
            1994 San Marino Grand Prix.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Witnesses said last
            month that due to damage, the recorder could not be
            connected up to the team's computer. Senna's
            Williams-Renault hit a concrete wall after leaving
            the track on the Tamburello bend. Marco Spiga, a
            technical expert called by state prosecutor Maurizio
            Passarini, attempted to show in court whether or not
            the Williams chassis data logging computer could be
            downloaded via three pin connectors supplied by
            Williams expert Giorgio Stirano. The session however,
            proved inconclusive because the recorder also
            requires the addition of a card, in order to upload
            data to a computer.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Passarini said: <i>&quot;Only
