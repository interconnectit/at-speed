            Fisichella</b> to slot in behind the German and then
            commenced harrying him for the first half of the
            race. Running a heavy fuel load, Alesi managed to eke
            out a small lead in the early laps but with speeds of
            the top five runners fairly evenly matched, he was
            never more than three seconds ahead of the Williams.</font></p>

            place, so Hakinnen was doing likewise to Villeneuve
            for 5th, setting the first of a string of fastest
            laps and by lap 20 with positions unchanged,
            Alesi&#146;s lead was slowly being eroded by Frentzen
            and Coulthard who seemed to be moving as one, so
            close were they lapping.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As fuel loads became
            lighter, the gaps started to close but the McLarens
            whilst fast in a straight line, lacked the
            Williams&#146; grip through the corners and the four
            drivers found themselves in a stalemate of sorts with
            Fisichella driving for all he was worth, a useless
            pawn in the centre. Fastest laps were reeled off by
            Fisichella, then Frentzen, then Coulthard and it was
            unusual not to see Schumacher&#146;s name on the
            list. The</font><a
            href="http://www.at-speed.co.uk/smn/fe97sp.htm"><font
            size="2" face="Arial"> <b>Ferrari </b></font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial">was indeed struggling over 10
            seconds behind the leader and making little headway.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lap 28 saw the first
            of the pit stops by Villeneuve trading his 5th spot
            for 11th and the following lap saw his team mate stop
            for scrubbed tyres giving Coulthard the opportunity,
            with clean air in front of him, to close up on Alesi.
            <i>&quot;our scheduled pit stop was too early at that
            stage.&quot;</i> said Frentzen after taking his third
            place. <i>&quot;At the end of the first run my lap
            times were quicker and I was surprised when David
            came out in front of me so I lost a place.&quot; </i>Villeneuve
            was in agreement but did not slam the team&#146;s
            faulty strategy in not allowing the Canadian to lose
            more of his fuel load enabling some quicker lap times
            prior to pitting. <i>&quot;It&#146;s always better to
            pit later than anyone else, but you can&#146;t always
            judge that before.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;We
            lost a lot of time in the pits independently of our
            strategy.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the front runners
            pitted, so Fisichella, Hakinnen and Schumacher all
            had their brief moments as leader of the pack but the
            significant moment came when on lap 33 both Alesi and
            Coulthard dived in for fuel and rubber
            simultaneously. Less than a second separated their
            positions yet the McLaren team, working like a well
            oiled machine, turned the car around in 7.8 seconds,
            nine tenths quicker than the </font><a
            href="http://www.at-speed.co.uk/smn/be97sp.htm"><font
            size="2" face="Arial">Benetton</font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial">. Coulthard closer to the pit
            exit, was off the blocks and running leaving his pit
            crew to dodge the sliding Alesi blasting off in hot
            pursuit, rejoining the race in 4th and 5th positions.
            Coulthard had been given the upper hand by superior
            teamwork and it was a gift that he was not to
            surrender under any circumstances. <i>&quot;We could
            have stayed out longer,&quot;</i> Coulthard said
            later. <i>&quot;but we saw Jean&#146;s pit board and
            thought it best to follow him in. I got out in front
            of Jean and it&#146;s all down to the mechanics&quot;</i>
            Praise where praise is due and it was indeed the key
            to the race. Alesi hung on grimly to the McLaren but
            was never able to mount a challenge crossing the line
            a fraction under 2 seconds down. <i>&quot;Starting
            from pole, I was looking for a win.&quot;</i> Said a
            far from disappointed Alesi. <i>&quot;David was in
            front of me at the pit stop and I was not able to
            overtake him.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From then on to the
            line, positions remained the same, the only
            excitement being provided at <i>Rettifilio</i> by <b>Johnny
            Herbert</b>&#146;s aerial ballet into the tyre

            size="2" face="Arial">, moved in on the Englishman
            leaving him nowhere to go but the grass.
            Herbert&#146;s front tyre hit the rear tyre of the </font><a
            href="http://www.at-speed.co.uk/smn/f1jots97.htm"><font
            size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jordan Peugeot</b> </font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial">and he surfed the gravel traps
            by way of an extremely fast final approach. <i>&quot;Ralf
            passed me and I wasn&#146;t worried.&quot;</i>
            Herbert sprightly and unhurt, said later. <i>&quot;As
            we came to brake he just tried to squeeze me a
            little. It would have been nice if I had had a little
            bit more room. My rear wheel may have gone on the
            grass. It was unnecessary and unacceptable and the
            sign of an inexperienced driver who has a lot to
            learn about driving at high speeds.&quot;</i>
            Schumacher had a different story to tell and
            reminiscent of his attitude towards his team mate
            Fisichella when he knocked him out in similar
            circumstances in Argentina, he was unrepentant
            towards the hapless Englishman. <i>&quot;He braked as
            I did and I left him enough space. Maybe he should
            have braked a little earlier, I had passed him
            already and I was in front. I felt him touch my rear
            wheel and I felt the car jump forward and at first I
            thought it was a bump, but then I saw Johnny spin
            off. I think it&#146;s his mistake not mine.&quot;</i>
            It did him no good either, as a lap later, he too
            retired with damaged rear suspension. He said, <i>&quot;The
            car felt unstable and I was not happy to drive like
            that.&quot;</i> It is hard to understand why he was
            not called before the stewards when Villeneuve was
            admonished with a one race suspended ban <i>for the
            rest of the season</i> for a far lesser infringement.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The unlucky Hakinnen
            having set yet another fastest lap was forced into
            the pits from 5th position with a badly flat spotted
            tyre, leaking air. This put him down to 14th place
            and effectively out of the race. Having had his third
            place taken away from him in Belgium due to a fuel
            illegality, suffering two heavy accident prior to
            that race and seeing his team mate leading the race
            he was now contesting, should have taken a toll on
            the Finn but some magnificent late charging took him
            up to 9th and gave him the fastest lap of the race. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">World Champion <b>Damon
            Hill</b>&#146;s under-powered </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial"><b> </b>was totally out of
            it&#146;s depth on the fast <i>Monza</i> circuit and
            on lap 48, no doubt totally exhausted, rattled itself
            to pieces for the 8th time in 13 races, exploding in
            a cloud of white oil smoke scattering droplets in
            front of the fast approaching McLaren of Hakinnen. It
            was an interesting way of gaining a position and
            despite Hill&#146;s body language as he slowly got
            out of his car, he seemed resigned to his fate. <i>&quot;It
            was a small engine problem. It just destroyed itself
            in front of Mika Hakinnen who was right behind me and
            I buried him in oil!&quot;</i> He joked. <i>&quot;But
            we weren&#146;t in the points, so it was a lot of
            hard work for nothing.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The flag fell on
            Coulthard after 53 laps of uninspiring racing, the
            muted reception from the crowd illustrated that the
            passion was missing this year. They had no one to
            cheer on and some took the option of a snooze in the
            35 degree sunshine. The battle that was supposed to
            be, never was, both championship contenders taking a
            back seat in a race of back seat driving. Schumacher
            came out the luckiest having only concede a point to
            his rival. <i>&quot;Competition was very close,
            &quot;</i> He said, talking about the power
            similarities of the top six finishers. <i>&quot;We
            were at the bottom of that competition line and we
            got the best out of it. We lost only one point which
            is satisfying.&quot;</i> Hardly words of consolation
            to his fans but he did not seem worried taking
            comfort that even the Williams were having an
            &#145;off&#146; day too. Villeneuve was similarly
            philosophical. <i>&quot;A point is better than
            nothing.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;We knew that
            this wouldn&#146;t be a great track for us and it was
            going to be worse for Ferrari but they managed to
            hang in there and finish 6th so we catch them a whole
            lot.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A disappointed
            Fisichella came in fourth and, after such an
            excellent result in Belgium and a very promising
            qualifying session, he had expected more. <i>&quot;I
            was really hoping to finish on the podium today, but
            the aim is always to finish in the points and 4th
            place is still wonderful in front of the crowds at
            Monza.&quot; </i>Talking about the race, he went on, <i>&quot;I
            was quite nervous and excited before the race and at
            the start I made a mistake which cost me a place. The
            race was very difficult and I was under a lot of
            pressure, especially from Villeneuve. I found the car
            &#145;nervous&#146; today and had some problems with
            understeer with the second set of tyres and really
            had to anticipate the curves.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It probably gladdened
            the hearts of countless British fans around the world
            that the Union Flag should be raised at the end of
            such a desperately sad week. Coulthard may enjoy his
            moment of glory, but the real battle has just been
            put on hold for a fortnight. The next race in <i>Austria</i>,
            Berger&#146;s Home Grand Prix, will see more Italian
            fans streaming across the border where hopefully,
            their hero will live up to expectation. As Coulthard
            said, <i>&quot;The A1-ring is like Monaco without the
            barriers.&quot;</i> It&#146;s a circuit that favours
            high downforce and exceptional cornering qualities.

            size="2" face="Arial"> lacked today, when a
            frightening moment as Coulthard put the car sideways
            through the second chicane, almost put him out of the
            race.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hollywood beef-cake <i>Sylvester
            Stallone </i>was prowling the pits, every inch the

            &#145;There will be sweat, passion conflict and

            fraternity can only hold its breath and grit
            it&#146;s teeth as to the probable outcome of such a
