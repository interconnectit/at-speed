            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Qualifying for
            the Brazilian GP threw up some surprising
            performances - quite a few of which were
            disappointing in the extreme... Chris Richardson
            reports.</strong></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As fickle as Formula 1
            is, it now seems traditional that <b>Williams</b>
            should always make the running. They did of course,
            make the running as expected, with Champion elect <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b> never losing Pole position from his
            first flying lap of the qualifying session at <b>Interlagos</b>.
            The fickle factor involved the rest of the track,
            with regular midfielders making up a good part of the
            front end of the grid. <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b>
            proved to be the big disappointment, being well and
            truly upstaged by his team mate and it was
            disconcerting to see his early sector times regularly
            disintegrate as he reeled off a series of rather
            unspectacular laps.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With a track
            temperature of 29 degrees and rising, the <b>Bridgestone</b>
            brigade made the early running, all having chosen the
            softer compound tyres for both qualifying and race.
            The benchmark was set inevitably by Villeneuve with a
            1.16.68. It has also become a familiar sight to see <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b> fighting a <b>Ferrari</b> that just
            wants to tango. It was no mean feat to get the big
            red jitterbug onto the front row with a final time of
            1.16.59, albeit over half a second down on the
            Williams.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the <b>Benetton</b>s
            of <b>Gerhard Berger</b> and <b>Jean Alesi</b>
            burning harder <b>Goodyear</b> rubber, both looked
            agitated. Berger&#146;s eagerness for good times was
            the cause of several &#145;wobbly&#146; moments and
            the smoke coming from Alesi&#146;s tyres signalled
            the Sicillian&#146;s on-going struggle with his own
            eagerness. He was hard pushed to qualify higher than
            sixth.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Olivier Panis</b>,
            given a new sense of self respect since his fortunate
            win in Monaco last year, did a brilliant job in
            putting his <b>Prost Mugen-Honda</b> onto the third
            row with an early fast time of 1.16.75, that he was
            not to beat. For a while it looked as though he might
            be on the second row but a slowly improving <b>Mika
            Hakkinen</b> in the <b>West McLaren Mercedes</b>
            shunted him down a slot. <strong>Coulthard, </strong>race
            winner in Melbourne, was conspicuous by his absence
            from the front of the pack. Suffering from set up
            problems, he was struggling to make headway, and
            finished up a thoroughly miserable 10th.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">World Champion <b>Damon
            Hill</b> of course, knows all about winning <i>and </i>the
            rapid fall from the victor&#146;s podium, to
            non-starter. It was therefore gratifying to see that
            a lot of the problems that plagued the <b>TWR Arrows</b>
            team in Melbourne, seemed to have been ironed out.
            Whilst suffering the same worrying throttle problem -
            that put him out on the warm up lap in Australia,
            during the first timed session on Friday -
            Hill&#146;s qualifying went almost without a hitch.
            The hitch being, that he just wasn&#146;t fast
            enough. However, it was the mark of a true champion
            that his smooth and economical driving, so
            reminiscent of &#145;<i>Professeur</i>&#146; Alain
            Prost - his old mentor at Williams - brought a truly
            uncompetitive car from 17th to 9th finishing the
            session a mere <i>8 hundredths</i> of a second behind
            the man that took over his seat at Williams,
            Frentzen. This must have given him some dour
            satisfaction and whilst the proximity of the two cars
            may be only a temporary thing it proves that there
            could be life in the <b>Arrows A18</b>. As Hill said,
            &quot;I think we&#146;ve shown we&#146;ve got what it
            takes. There is more to come and we are working all
            the time to improve things. We have a lot of things
            in the pipeline a new engine and aerodynamic
            improvements. We are working with Bridgestone to
            adapt the tyres to do what we need them to do.&quot;
            His chances of holding on to Frentzen in the race are
            fairly slim, but that didn&#146;t seem important to
            him. &quot;We want to get to the finish,&quot; he
            grinned, &quot;That&#146;ll be a real
            achievement!&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Eddie Irvine</b> in
            the second Ferrari languished at the back in 14th
            position to the rejoicing of Villeneuve with whom he
            had a first corner altercation at Melbourne. Asked
            about the importance of his start, Villeneuve
            replied, &quot;Eddie is pretty far behind so we
            should be OK tomorrow&quot;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As far as Villeneuve
            is away from Irvine, the luckless <b>Johnny Herbert, </b>another
            victim of Irvine&#146;s impetuosity is, as
            dangerously close. Right beside him in fact. Herbert
            will no doubt feel his hackles rise as the red lights
            go out and wait for the inevitable bang. In the game
            reserves of Formula One <b>Saubers</b> and Ferraris
            are uneasy companions at the watering hole, despite
            sharing the same engine.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b> and team mate <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>
            had an interesting session, finishing ahead of
            Frentzen on 1.16.9 and behind Hill with 1.17.17,
            respectively. Fisichella managed to stuff his car
            into the tyre wall a minute and a half from the end
            of practice causing a red flag to be shown. &quot;I
            was going too much speed.&quot; Giancarlo said
            eloquently, which is probably what team boss <b>Eddie
            Jordan</b> will be, faced with the costs of replacing
            the <b>Jordan Peugeot</b>&#146;s front suspension and
            wings. The Jordans should be finishing higher up the
            field and it looks doubtful that the relationship
            with Peugeot will proceed into 1998 if things
            continue in this manner. Ironically the red flag
            interrupted the fastest lap that Ralf Schumacher had
            done all session, &quot;I was on a quick lap and when
            we hit the red flag it destroyed my lap.&quot;
            Schumacher found it pointless to rejoin the scrum
            when the session blipped into life for the final 109
            seconds, &quot;...and then we didn&#146;t have a new
            set of tyres. We fucked up.&quot; Eloquent also, to
            his global audience.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jarno Trulli</b>
            put in a sterling performance in the <b>Minardi Hart</b>,
            now gaining respect and credibility and against
            fierce competition on the lower levels, finished
            17th. The two <b>Tyrell</b>s showing all the signs of
            yet another season with all hopes abandoned, ended up
            last and err,last, <b>Mika Salo</b> never managing a
            lap before the aging Ford powerplant gave up the
            ghost.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last of the promising
            pursuers was <b>Rubens Barrichello</b> this year
            looking far happier in a smaller team that obviously
            cares for him and doesn&#146;t put him under so much
            pressure. &quot;I tried like hell on my last flying
            lap and the car was on the limit,&quot; said the
            smiling Brazilian, &quot;but the time just
            didn&#146;t come. I was disappointed when I saw it.
            But this is only our second race and its very
            satisfying to me to be 11th. I want to finish the
            race tomorrow. For me, that&#146;s the biggest thing
            this weekend. I think we <i>can</i> finish in the top
            ten.&quot; Maybe Rubens was reading out his press
            release from Australia but his enthusiasm for <b>Stewart
            Racing</b> seems to know no bounds.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The mad scramble to
            get past the chequered flag before the time ran out,
            was futile. A water leak forced Villeneuve to drive
            the spare car and he could not better his time.
            Neither could Michael Schumacher who aborted his lap
            after realising that his Ferrari again wanted to go
            to the <i>&#145;Carnival&#146;. </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both Berger and
            Coulthard ran out of fuel on the final lap
            illustrating the desperation of the teams to get as
            good a time as possible whilst carrying the minimum
            weight.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A mixed bag for the
            Brazilian Grand Prix. The outcome merely delayed for
            three weeks, has to be a top step for Villeneuve.
            Where Frentzen fits into the picture, even <b>Frank
            Williams</b> probably does not know. If
            Ferrari&#146;s mechanics burn the midnight oil and
            sort out some of it&#146;s handling problems, then
            Schumacher senior will be a hard man to beat also.
            However, throw in a little rain.........</font></p>

            <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>What's with the
            Britpack?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Damon Hill's
            excuse for qualifying ninth is that he's driving a
            relatively poor car - but the other Britons have
            supposedly better equipment. Dave Coveney tries to
            find a reason for the poor British performance.</strong></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">OOOKAAAY! David
            Coulthard did it! He finally won a race for McLaren
            at Melbourne! Everyone in Britain was elated. So what
            if Damon Hill was now relegated to embarrasing
            formation lap retirements and back of grid
            qualification - a new star was born at the first race
            of the 1997 season. Our top driver now had to be the
            square headed one from Scotland.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So tuning in to the
            qualifying session of the Interlagos GP must have
            seemed strange - where was the new hero? And how come
            Hill was leading him? Oh dear. Oh deary me. More
            worrying still was the fact Coulthard seemed unable
            to do anything about it. From hero to zero. 12<sup>th</sup>
            place on the grid. Not good enough if you want to
            stand out as a future champion.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This wouldn't have
            seemed so bad if Johnny Herbert had paid out on his
            promising practice form. On Friday at one point he'd
            been second only to Jaques Villeneuve in the
            dominating Williams and at the end of the day a
            fourth position looked comfortable. But instead of
            scintillating form, his qualifying session was sad to
            say the least. A final placing just behind Coulthard
            in 13<sup>th</sup> was an unhappy end to Saturday's
            driving.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">And Lo! Who do we
            find, nestled up with these two other Brits but a
            third! Eddie Irvine - 12 places behind his team-mate
            Michael Schumacher. It's as if, having tasted the
            limelight in one form or other at Melbourne, these
            guys had all decided that they couldn't hack it and
            had to let the current World Champion come ahead of
            them. All that and in a car that until yesterday had
            looked like a very sad machine indeed. Damon Hill. 9<sup>th</sup>
            position. Top Brit.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tom Walkinshaw and
            Damon Hill must be laughing their socks off. Messrs
            Irvine, Coulthard, and Herbert have often been quick
            to criticise the quiet Englishman. Too eager to point
            out his flaws, in public, on British TV, and in the
            press.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although Hill stands
            almost zero chance of retaining his title this year,
            he already seems to be winning critical acclaim.
            Driving the best machinery over four years had left
            doubts over his true ability. The chance to prove
            himself would come when he found himself in a poorer
            team than Williams. He still has to prove the
            Arrows-Yamaha in a race, but should he manage to beat
            his compatriots in tomorrow's race then he'll have
            shown that he can never be discounted from the GP
            grid.</font></p>
