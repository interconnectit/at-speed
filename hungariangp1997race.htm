            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tyre compound choice
            was again crucial and most of the <b>Goodyear</b>
            runners had gone for the soft option. Hot weather
            before, has caused blistering especially with the
            Ferrari&#146;s and it was therefore unusual to find
            them opting for the stickier tyres with a track
            temperature of 32 degrees and rising.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With all the best
            plans laid for a faultless race, a spin in the warm
            up session ended <b>Michael Schumacher</b>&#146;s
            chance of that statistical win. Losing all the
            advantage that the new lightweight chassis and
            it&#146;s extra fuel carrying capacity brought to his
            qualifying performance, he was forced to use the
            spare car and as such, was slow to leave the grid
            when the lights went out.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Struggling on the
            &#145;dirty&#146; side of the track <strong>Jacques
            Villeneuve</strong>, as predicted, failed to find the
            right traction for a smooth getaway.<i> &quot;My
            start was pretty bad.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;Whether
            it was wheel spin or clutch slip I didn&#146;t go
            anywhere.&quot; </i>It was Hill drawing level with
            Schumacher at the first turn, who slotted in behind
            the German after also fending off the second Ferrari
            of <b>Eddie Irvine</b> who stuck with the leading
            pair for barely 4 laps before entering the pits with
            tyre balance problems, serving as a warning for his
            team mate, that similar problems might occur. In an
            ironic pre race statement Irvine said that <i>&quot;We&#146;ve
            never been in such good shape for a race.&quot;</i>
            He should know better than to tell the world that for
            whatever excuses Ferrari might put out later, they
            could easily be ridiculed</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill, by lap 4, had
            set the fastest lap of 1.19.6 and was harrying
            Schumacher&#146;s Ferrari for the front slot. <i>&quot;The
            first couple of laps he (Schumacher) was pulling
            away.&quot;</i> He said.<i> &quot;Then I managed to
            close in on him quite easily and you could see that
            his tyres were blistering. I knew I had to pass him
            as there were cars coming up behind and I could go a
            lot quicker.&quot; </i>This he did at the end of the
            pit straight on lap 10, squeezing through a gap that
            the Ferrari driver was extremely reluctant to
            concede. Once passed, he was away and apart from a
            brief stint in second behind <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b>
            when he made his first stop, he commanded the race
            until his untimely demise. </font></p>

            make the best of starts, but I managed to stay in the

            &quot;After a few laps I began to have problems with
            my tyres, which we had not seen in practice. The
            front tyres should have been the ones to give
            trouble, so I was surprised to see blisters on the
            rears. The second set worked properly, but the next
            two had the same problems as the first. I had to run
            at a slower pace in order to look after my

            was looking good, but I was stuck behind
            Villeneuve.&quot;</i> It was a keen observation by
            the Finn, as Villeneuve was indeed making little
            progress, the Williams looking sluggish and plodding.
            With Schumacher in the pits for the first of
            seemingly many tyre changes, Villeneuve was suddenly
            in second place in front of team mate Frentzen, who
            was setting a fastest lap of 1.19.03s. Was this to be
            a comeback for Williams?</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the time that the
            first pit stops were due, Hill had a seven second
            lead over Villeneuve. The Canadian, suffering a
            longer stop than Hill who stopped a lap later, lost
            nearly two seconds to the Arrows stop of 8.9s due to
            a sticking wheel nut. With <b>David Coulthard</b>
            running up the pitlane behind the Williams, they
            rejoined the race in 3rd and 4th places, Hill having
            managed a lightening &#145;in&#146; lap to maintain a
            9 second gap over Villeneuve on exiting the pits.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Frentzen had the lead
            and 19 seconds on Hill, but after setting another
            fast lap of 1.18.3, the refuelling coupling flew off
            his car and ominous gouts of flame started erupting
            intermittently from the rear. It was therefore not
            surprising to see the pit crew waiving their hands
            horizontally to signify that it was all over when
            Frentzen finally came to a rest in the pits, slinging
            his wheel away unceremoniously as he got out of the
            car. </font></p>

            forced to let him go until on lap 65 his race came to
            a standstill with a failed alternator. This pushed
            Herbert up to third and Schumacher senior 4th, his

            An <b>Arrows Yamaha </b>fronting a Grand Prix, 34
            seconds ahead, must indeed have been a strange
            experience for the team and when Hill reported on the
            radio that his throttle was not backing off, there
            still must have been optimism that within two and a
            half minutes the race would be theirs. This was not
            to be. Still staying on course, Hill was slowing
            rapidly and Villeneuve began to eat the seconds
            hungrily. <i>&quot;Damon was really flying, but I
            thought that there was no way he could finish&quot; </i>Villeneuve
            said.<i> &quot;By the end of the race it was looking
            pretty grim because he was going on and on and on.
            Then, the pit crew told me he was slowing down. When
            I got to him I saw he was going left and right and I
            knew he was going to block me which was normal on the
            last lap, so I just went onto the grass. He had the
            race in his pocket, It&#146;s a shame for him.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As Hill slowed, unable
            to select his gears, he started swerving the car to
            try to rejoin his severed electrical connections.
            Villeneuve passed in a cloud of dirt as he ran along
            the grass verge and into the final 4 corners that
            would take him to an extremely fortuitous victory 9
            seconds up on the Arrows. Hill&#146;s lead over third
            placed <b>Johnny Herbert</b> was such that he managed
            to cross the line 11 seconds in front so salvaging 6
            points from his days work.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill was in a

            fair, second place is better than nothing, and we
            almost got nothing. The car was really coughing and

            stopped completely. I had Tom(Walkinshaw) on the

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For Yamaha too, it
            would have been a maiden victory but ironically,
            having for so long relied on and been let down by,
            the V10 to keep them going, the tables were now
            reversed. Rough justice perhaps, it was the car that
            let the engine down at the crucial moment. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the two Union flags
            hung above the podium flanking the Maple leaf of
            Canada, the National Anthem played for the winning
            constructor, Williams. It could have been a
            reconstruction of so many of last years results. It
            was hard not to make comparisons with Hill&#146;s

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">An early tussle with
            his arch nemesis brought back briefly the glory days
            of 1994, and with it the nostalgic pleasure of seeing
            this English Gentleman at his finest. Team boss <b>Frank
            Williams,</b> whilst pleased that he lucked in to 10
            constructors points, must surely realise that this
            was not his victory. Poor race preparation and
            average pitlane activities would not have won </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial">this race. It will have done
            Hill a great deal of good regarding the allocation of
            competitive drives for next season. The chances of a
            seat with McLaren look more positive, but as with
            Berger, it may not be possible to maintain this form.
            The next race in Belgium is a different circuit, all
            about fast corners and straight line speed and Hill
            must reconcile himself to the possibility of again
            qualifying back in the mid field. Hill has driven a
            lot of excellent races this season and it is all too
            obvious that, with his wealth of qualifying
            experience and &#145;given the right equipment&#146;,
            as he once said, he is more capable than most of
            doing the job.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">His win would have
            been a popular one, as Berger&#146;s was at <i>Hockenheim.</i>
            Schumacher, speaking probably for himself still
            echoed the sentiments of the collective pit-lane bar
            one team perhaps, when he said,<i> &quot;I hoped Hill
            would win, as he deserved to and also because it
            would have helped me in the championship. I must
            congratulate him and the team on the good job they
            did.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the mellowing of
            his arrogant ways over the past two seasons more
            often than not, Schumacher can display more than a
            touch of benevolence and it was almost with a sense
            of regret that he finished with, &quot;<i>It was like
            the old days, we two battling, unfortunately I
            couldn&#146;t fight back, but maybe next
            time...&quot;</i></font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Maybe Hill had a small
            moment on the Podium before the champagne party began
            when he heard that Anthem. It played for him as much
            as for Williams and it must have gladdened the hearts
            of millions of his fans globally, that he was back
            where he rightfully belongs.</font></p>
