            </font><font size="1" face="Arial">When the car goes,
            it goes very well indeed...</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One day, I'm going to
            arrive at the circuit, the car will qualify without
            anything breaking, jamming or stopping, I won't hit
            anything, or have odd vibrations, I'll qualify well
            and I'll be in the right frame of mind to start the
            race after which the car will be returned to the
            trailer without needing any remedial work. I'm not an
            unreasonable person, I'd just like to experience this
            once in my life.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Instead of this
            nirvana, the day started off badly and got
            progressively worse, yet it was still one of the most
            enjoyable races of my life, if very frustrating. I
            say it, because I had to withdraw from one of the two
            races I was scheduled to run, but more of that later.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Autosport Guide to
            Oulton Park begins &quot;Many drivers have a
            love-hate relationship with this scenic venue. Its
            beautiful scenery is matched by the spectacular and
            demanding nature of the track.&quot; It was only my
            second visit to this track despite it being one of
            the three circuits which are all roughly the same
            distance away from home - roughly 90 minutes by car.
            I like Oulton, but have always struggled a bit there
            - largely because of the two fussy chicanes which
            have been inserted over the years. I just can't seem
            to get the right degree of aggression.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Come race day, we set
            off early having left the car there the night before
            for the 'pit crew' to look after overnight - or so I
            thought. Their car broke down on the way - complete
            loss of compression on No 1 cylinder - so I was on my
            own for race day.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just over half way
            there I suddenly realised that I had forgotten my
            race licence, so I had to double back in some haste.
            All this put us over two ours behind schedule, but
            somehow still managed to get to the track in time to
            have the car scrutineered and make the tail end of
            the Formula Saloons qualifying session. So something
            was salvaged. Unfortunately, the car had developed a
            HUGE vibration which felt like axle tramp that was
            making the car undrivable under deceleration - even
            on just a trailing throttle. It was so bad it
            actually pitched me off the track at one of the
            chicanes on the out lap.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Feeling that
            discretion was called for I returned immediately to
            the pits and began looking for the cause.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One thing that has to
            be said for the CSCC is that it is truly a club with
            all that implies. Fellow Group 2 competitors and
            others from other CSCC championships all lent a hand
            in trying to diagnose the problem, but none of us
            could find anything. In the end, more in hope and
            desperation than anything else, I replaced the front
            wheels with the same set I had used last time out as
            it was the only change made since I last ran the car.
            The good news was instant cure of the new vibration
            for the Group 2 qualifying session. The bad news was
            that although I had also replaced a suspect half
            shaft wheel bearing the week leading up to the race,
            the transmission noise and harshness remained - so
            the session was spent more trying to identify the
            source of that problem than get a good grid position.
            Still, I was not unhappy to see myself third on the
            time sheets confident I could go much quicker.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">What I am still
            baffled by is just how a front wheel induced
            vibration can feel like it is coming from the back
            and only on deceleration. Any ideas will be warmly
            welcomed as I am not usually so wrong with my
            diagnoses.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Anyway, deciding that
            the car probably wouldn't stand two races, I elected
            t withdraw from the Formula Saloons race - for which
            I hadn't qualified as I'd only done one lap and would
            have had to start from the back of the grid anyway.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This as it turns out
            was not a good idea as I will explain later.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Come the Group 2 race,
            we lined up and at the lights I made a good start
            which meant we were three abreast into the first
            corner, getting squeezed onto the grass and back to
            third for my troubles on the way out. </font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
            src="ch97op02.jpg" width="375" height="256"><br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Arial">A tense battle for
            the lead meant a lot of action and tyre smoke.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The three of us
            battled for first with usually never more than a
            couple of feet between us - except when I had
            encountered selection problems out of the
            Knickerbrook chicane. This was both good and bad.
            Obviously it was a further problem, but the upside
            was that it confirmed that I had a significant
            performance advantage as I was able to claw back as
            much as 8 or so car lengths in less than half a lap
            and the 'drive around' was not a significant problem.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A short while later we
            were three abreast into the fast Island bend - again
            getting squeezed onto the grass for my trouble, again
            finding myself back in third, but with a new race
            leader. Within a lap I had taken second as was ready
            to launch a serious bit for first.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Diving down the
            outside for the Shell Hairpin looking to take the
            long way round the banked corner and defend an inside
            line into the following chicane - a move I am still
            sure would have succeeded - I found myself without
            any brakes to speak of. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Somehow, I managed to
            half spin the excess speed away and keep it all
            together, but my race was run. The remain few laps
            was all about limping to the end to be classified as
            a finisher.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
            src="ch97op03.jpg" width="375" height="259"><br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Arial">The rear end view
            that Chris would like to show more of!</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The following morning,
            the cause of the brake loss was all too apparent and
            took all of one second to fix. A bleed nipple had
            worked loose. I am certain that I could have one the
            race and made it two group 2 wins in 2 starts, and
            set a new lap record in the process, so had I run in
            the Formula Saloons race I might have identified and
            fixed the problem in time. Still, second fastest time
            while dicing wasn't too bad and the potential is
            clear - and the racing while it lasted was some of
            the most enjoyable I have ever had.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next round is two
            months away, so I will have time to get to the bottom
            of whatever the transmission problems are.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But maybe, the next
            race meeting will be that Utopian state I talked
            about at the start.</font></p>
