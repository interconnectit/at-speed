            face="Arial">he French have more motor racing
            circuits than any other European country. With at
            least 25 in irregular use, there are probably more
            tucked away behind vineyards and deep within forests,
            that probably even the French don&#146;t know about.
            Auto racing was introduced in France with the
            establishment of the <b>Auto Club de France</b> in
            1895 and a city to city race between Bordeaux and
            Paris. With an international series inaugurated by
            the American Newspaper mogul <i>James Gordon Bennett</i>
            in 1900, the <i>&#145;Coupe Internationale&#146;</i>
            became a hotly contested race for the <i>Gordon
            Bennett cup</i>. But with the massive death toll that
            City to City racing brought <i>(12 people died in the
            Paris-Madrid race in 1903 including one of the
            Renault brothers, Marcel)</i>, and the fact that the
            rules, laid down by the American precluded the
            national entry to a maximum of three cars, the ACF
            refused any further participation in the Gordon
            Bennett races. The name of the race was changed in
            1906 to the <i>Grand Prix de l&#146;ACF</i> hence
            introducing the now common epithet to all subsequent
            international competitions.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first Grand Prix
            of 12 laps in the same year, was held over two days
            on a 65mile(105km) circuit near Le Mans and was won
            by one <b>Ferenc Szisz</b> in a 13 litre 4 cylinder
            works Renault. Since then the French Grand Prix has
            had many venues. Circuits at <b>Reims,</b> <b>Dijon</b>
            in Burgundy and the <i>Paul Ricard circuit</i> at <b>Le
            Castellet</b> near Marseilles, hosted the majority in
            later times, but <b>Pau</b> in the foothills of the
            Pyrenees, <b>Albi</b> near Toulouse, <b>Rouen les
            Essarts</b> in Northern France and the <i>Louis
            Rosier circuit</i> at <b>Charade</b> near
            Clermont-Ferrand, all hosted races.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The French Grand Prix
            has always been eventful. The 1926 race at <b>Miramas</b>,
            contested by 3 <b>Bugattis</b>,<b> </b>due to a
            constructor&#146;s strike, was the smallest in GP
            history. It also boasted the longest winning margin
            of 15 laps. In 1953 <b>Mike Hawthorn</b> gave his
            first win for <b>Ferrari</b> narrowly beating <b>Fangio</b>&#146;s
            <b>Maserati</b> at the final turn. 1960 saw the <b>Cooper
            Climax</b> take the most definitive victory of all
            time when <b>Jack Brabham</b> lead them home 1, 2, 3 <i>and</i>

            size="2" face="Arial">&#146;s first win, <b>Jean-Pierre
            Jabouille</b> scored the second for the Marque and a
            first for a turbocharged car. The race was memorable
            for the fantastic wheel banging duel for second place
            between <b>Gilles Villeneuve</b> in a Ferrari and <b>Rene
            Arnoux</b> in the second Renault, in which positions
            were exchanged several times in the last lap. The
            Ferrari took the place by just 0.24 of a second. <b>Alain
            Prost </b>won the first of his 51 races at Dijon and
            returned to win three times in a row in &#146;88,
            &#145;89&#146; and &#146;90 at Paul Ricard.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <i>Circuit de
            Nevers</i> at <b>Magny Cours, </b>near Nevers,
            originally the proving ground of many French drivers
            passing through the Winfield Racing School, was
            totally refurbished in 1988, when French President
            Mitterrand took an interest in bringing Grand Prix
            racing to a largly rural area, enabling it to become
            the regular home to the French Grand Prix, the first
            of which was held in 1991. The <b>Ligier</b> Formula
            1 team (now <b>Prost</b>) made their home their in
            purpose-built accommodation beside the track and have
            only recently moved to larger premises near Paris. It
            is the first of a series of fast tracks that form the
            mid part of the F1 season and is a mix of medium
            corners, tight hairpins and long, fast curves.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Magny Cours is
            perhaps, the most notorious track when it comes to
            changes in temperature and atmospheric conditions. <b>Gary

            &quot;In qualifying instead of the teams waiting
            until the end of the session to make the best times,
            there is usually a rush to get out early before it
            becomes too hot. Overall the set-up is a balance
            between downforce and strait line speed. Downforce
            for the Estoril bend and straight line speed so you
            can be quick at the end of the straight and overtake
            (under braking) at Adelaide (Hairpin).&quot;</i></font></p>

            Canadian Gran Prix, Said, <i>&quot;Magny Cours is a
            good circuit for me because I love chicanes and so it
            suits my driving style. I do not really enjoy the
            hairpin (Adelaide), because it is so slow and the 180
            degree bend is also slow and you usually have
            problems with understeer. It is a medium grip circuit
            but the track surface is really smooth which is
            excellent.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The most important
            corner in qualifying according to the majority of
            drivers, is the final tight right hander <i>(Lycee)</i>
            that leads into the start-finish straight. Putting
            power down hear is extremely important and has to be
            done firmly but progressively. <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>
            says, <i>&quot;Lycee, which is a very low grip corner
            is very important because it affects your speed on
            the straight.&quot;</i></font></p>

            most notable feature, is that the track is
            billiard-table smooth. This and the nature of the
            surface itself, means that finding a set-up can be a
            very specific task. It can be a nightmare until you
            dial into the circuit. We made quite major gains in
            set-up over the recent two days we tested here.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This should be

            we still have a lot to achieve. There is so much to
            be done now and we are working to close the gap.
            Previously it was a question of a year, now it is a

            should heed, for that <i>&#145;matter of
