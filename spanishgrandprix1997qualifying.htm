            face="Arial"><strong>Jacques Villeneuve</strong>
            today established why he remains the favourite for
            the 1997 World Championship. A cool qualification
            where he waited until the closing moments of the
            session before emulating his former team-mate Damon
            Hill by snatching pole with an unbeatable run.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Initially it looked as
            if qualifying was in the hands of the Gods... rain
            was spitting onto the circuit and for a while there
            was a worry that it may become a wet session. As a
            result all the teams pushed their cars out at the
            very beginning of the session. Fortunately the rain
            really did stay on the plain. and it was possible to
            have a normal fight for qualifying.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Cinderella story
            of Monaco looks unlikely to repeat itself. Michael
            Schumacher&#146;s Ferrari was never at its best on
            this circuit and it soon showed an even worse side to
            it&#146;s nature by blowing up its Evo-2 engine after
            just a couple of laps. Michael&#146;s team-mate,
            Eddie Irvine, fared even worse by qualifying in 11th
            position. Having said that, Irvine&#146;s usual
            position on the grid these days is in the middle of
            the pack. His race form, however, is a different
            story-he seems to achieve the impossible and is now a
            regular podium finisher. Michael Schumacher continued
            trying for a fast time in his spare car, but
            ultimately found he could do little to improve on the
            time he'd set early on. A disappointing 7<sup>th</sup>
            place means that he'll be lucky to leave Spain with a
            satisfactory result.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The stars of the last
            race, Stewart, were unable to show any promise today.
            It&#146;s strange to see the car that finished the
            last race in 2<sup>nd</sup> come so far back in
            qualifying at Barcelona. It&#146;s possible that the
            race will bring some good results, but it seems that
            the Ford power plant is unable to help when it comer
            to circuits where power is a priority. It's quite
            obvious that the car has potential - you only have to
            see the surprised looks on people's faces when they
            manage to do well. With a bigger budget the Stewart
            team has every chance of becoming a major Formula One
            player in the very near future.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was interesting to
            note that the new Goodyear tyres have improved the
            situation for many of the teams. Teams, that is, that
            weren&#146;t running on Bridgestone tyres. In fact,
            it was this factor which made Damon Hill&#146;s
            position look somewhat better than it might have
            done. A dismal warm-up to </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">the Grand Prix of
            Spain had left the World Champion languish ing at the
            back of the field complete with a one lap penalty to
            be applied to his qualifying session. l5th place
            didn&#146;t look too bad in the circumstances, and at
            least the Arrows seems to be finding some
            reliability. Having said </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">that, 15<sup>th</sup>
            ir no place for a World Champion and Tom Walkinshaw
            will have to work pretty hard if he wants to retain
            the driver in 1998.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Elsewhere the two
            Jordans qualified in ?th place... nothing to be
            disappointed about, but they&#146;ll have to work
            hard to keep up with the McLaren team who improved on
            their recent poor performances to do well with both
            Coulthard and Hakkinen qualifying in 3th &amp; 5th
            respectively.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But the star of the
            day was Jacques Villeneuve. His team-mate, Heinz
            Harald Frentzen had looked like the likely
            pole-sitter for most of the session. A cool and
            stunning drive by the German was better than
            Villeneuve's by such a margin that it looked to be
            his pole for the weekend. But Villeneuve came out
            near the end of the sessions and did exactly what he
            needed to secure the treasured pole position - he
            went faster than his team-mate and he transferred all
            the pressure across. His ability to deal with
            pressure and transfer it onto others is an excellent
            strength to have in a sport which can be as much of a
            mind game as it is racing. If he can make a half
            decent start on Sunday, and he's not been too great
            lately, then he has to be the favourite - but
            don&#146;t discount his German friend...</font></p>
