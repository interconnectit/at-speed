            that his brother <b>Ralf Schumacher </b>so nearly
            shared the front row with him. In an hour that

            young Schumacher surprised himself by putting in an
            early quick lap to establish his credibility as a
            potential front runner. <i>&quot;I did not really
            expect this result and so I am very happy,&quot; </i>He
            said afterwards.<i> &quot; but I want to keep my
            expectations realistic, meaning that my aim is to
            finish the race, obviously in the points if I
            can.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Amid new controversy
            over fresh verbal outbursts from a bleach-headed <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b>, the drivers took a protective stance
            over the gravity of the accident that caused <b>Prost</b>
            driver <b>Olivier Panis</b> to break both his legs at
            Montreal. Villeneuve, expressing his disapproval over
            the &#145;political correctness&#146; of Formula 1
            said, <i>&quot; When someone has an accident everyone
            acts as if they are sad, but they don&#146;t really
            care. As a driver you take risks and if you
            can&#146;t accept them you shouldn&#146;t be out
            there.&quot;</i> He went on to say <i>&quot;If you
            consider it, two broken legs is not that bad. Skiers
            get hurt every winter. Olivier is having a great
            season and he will be able to come back in a racing
            car. If he was a skier he would be off a long
            time.&quot;</i> The same could of course be said
            about Ice skaters and Ballet dancers but the ever
            present risk of fatal injuries is not so omnipresent
            as it is when one is travelling at 150 km/h and <b>David
            Coulthard</b> spoke for many when he said, <i>&quot;The
            last time we saw a driver laid out on the side of the
            track like that was </i><b><i>Ayrton Senna</i></b><i>.
            The drivers are sincere in their concern.&quot;</i>
            Coulthard a close neighbour of Villeneuve in Monte
            Carlo added, <i>&quot;I am equally sure that they
            would be equally concerned if they saw Jacques laid
            out on the track.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ironically, Jacques
            Villeneuve had a massive &#145;off&#146; during the
            morning&#146;s warm-up session damaging his car so
            badly, that it took the William&#146;s mechanics
            until the last 15 minutes of the session to repair
            it. Hence, having to drive first, the spare car, set
            up for <b>HeinzHarald Frentzen</b> and then his own
            for his last two laps, he only managed 4th in a
            session that he no doubt fully expected to dominate.
            The honours for Williams were left to Frentzen and
            with a late charge, broke the family monopoly of the
            front row by posting a time of 1.14.74s, six one

            would have made Hill look very good indeed and there

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuve&#146;s
            final quip was aimed at Schumacher when he echoed a
            thought that many journalists harbour in the light of
            Schumacher&#146;s suggestions that with the faster
            circuits he would not be able to maintain his
            championship advantage. <i>&quot;He always plays down
            his chances because, if he wins, then he seems an
            even bigger hero.&quot; </i>He added in deference to
            the two times World Champion, <i>&quot;He&#146;s a
            great driver. He drives the Hell out of the
            Ferrari.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher, whilst
            admitting that none of the drivers were very close,
            did talk of <i>&#145;looking after each other&#146;</i>
            but when it came to the bottom line, <i>&quot;It&#146;s
            our job to make the sport as safe as possible.&quot;</i>
            Schumacher has of course, made the fewest mistakes of
            most in his career so far and it may be easy for him
            to say. For a young &#145;hothead&#146; like
            Villeneuve, desperate for the thrill of the chase and
            the glory of winning, it&#146;s equivalent to him
            putting on slippers and taking up a pipe. He should
            take heed however of his coming together with the
            barriers today, for if he had hit them as Panis did
            maybe he would be &#145;resting up&#146; for the next
            two months.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sight of three
            Germans heading a Grand Prix however briefly, is a
            sight not seen since the war, but it will surely be
            one that is probably not likely to maintain its
            presence over 72 laps. A certain Canadian might see
            to that.</font></p>
