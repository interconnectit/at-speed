            from tyre newcomers Bridgestone, current World
            Champion Damon Hill, and Prost driver Olivier Panis.

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the <b>Brazilian
            Grand Prix</b> at <b>Interlagos </b>on Sunday,<b>
            Williams</b> driver <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>
            narrowly managed to avoid what is now becoming a
            regular destiny with the first corner, to go on and
            take the flag and the first points on his
            championship trail. With the quality of both Japanese
            newcomer <b>Bridgestone </b>tyres and the well
            established<b> Goodyear </b>playing a crucial part in
            the overall number of pit stops a team should go for,
            it was crucial for Villeneuve to show his rivals a
            clean pair of heels. Most of the Goodyear shod cars
            were running a hard compound and carrying a lighter
            fuel load, aiming for at least two pit stops. The
            Bridgestones however, have proved to be a great deal
            more durable, allowing the drivers to use a
            &#145;sticky&#146; tyre providing more grip and
            enabling them to go for a single stop strategy.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the red lights went
            out, Villeneuve made another poor start allowing <b>Michael
            Schumacher </b>to match his pace through the series
            of bends called the Senna S&#146;s. The <b>Ferrari</b>
            having taken the inside line on the first part, was
            being agitated by Villeneuve who, starting on the
            right hand side of the track, was starting to push
            through, to take the inside of the following right
            hander. Being hard but fair, Schumacher held on,
            forcing the Williams onto the dirt and dust just off
            the racing line. The blue and white car lost
            it&#146;s back end and headed for a short cut accross
            the dirt. Meanwhile <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b> in
            the leading Jordan decided to spin at the same point
            a few seconds later, rolling into the <b>Arrows A18</b>
            of <b>Damon Hill</b> and causing the World Champion
            to take to the air briefly, damaging both his
            suspension and wing. <i>&quot;I was lucky that the
            race was restarted. I am not sure what happened on
            the first start,&quot; </i>Fisichella said
            afterwards, &quot;<i>all I remember is seeing Hill
            coming up on one side and then spinning.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Formula 1 more than
            most sports it is possible to see history repeat
            itself with regularity and so it seems that <b>Johnny
            Herbert&#146;</b>s fears were yet again well founded,
            as a coming together with <b>Eddie Irvine</b> seemed
            inevitable judging by their proximity on the grid.
            Again at the Senna S, and, possibly taking action to
            avoid Fisichella&#146;s spinning Jordan, the front
            wheel of the Ferrari seemed to catch the rear wheel
            of the <b>Sauber Petronas</b> lifting it slightly. As
            Herbert continued through the curves Irvine having
            lost momentum, was shunted by <b>Jan Magnussen</b>&#146;s
            <b>Stewart Ford</b>. <i>&quot;Irvine was going slow
            in front of me,&quot; </i>said Magnussen, <i>&quot;I
            tried to go round the outside of him but he must have
            been looking at the other mirror so he could not see
            me. He started coming out, and I was on the curb. I
            could not do much: he kept going and ended up driving
            over my front wheel. That was it for me.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="msc97aa.jpg" width="384"
            height="256"></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile back at the
            ranch, team mate <b>Rubens Barichello</b> had been
            left standing at the grid when his &#145;drive by
            wire&#146; safety system shut the car down. <i>&quot;I
            had a problem with the throttle: it wouldn&#146;t go,
            then it revved very high and the engine stalled. I
            was trying to put it into neutral when the marshals
            told me I had to get out of the car.&quot;</i> He
            said afterwards. The race was immediately red-flagged
            and a mad scramble followed as mechanics and teams
            struggled to get spare cars set up and damaged body
            work replaced. Hill, already in the spare due to a
            fuel leak in his race car, had a new nose section and
            large parts of the suspension substituted whilst
            Barichello benefited from his number one driver
            status by bagging the Stewart T-car.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On the second start,
            again Villeneuve made a poor getaway, enabling the
            over- fueled Ferrari to blast into the lead. <b>Ukyo
            Katayama</b> stalled at the line but was able to
            start the race in his <b>Minardi</b> from the pit
            lane two laps down. Status quo was soon restored at
            the end of the second lap with Villeneuve taking the
            lead at the end of the pit strait and already setting
            an early fastest lap of 1.19.00. The <b>McLaren
            Mercedes</b> of <b>Mika Hakkinen</b> and <b>Gerhard
            Berger</b>&#146;s <b>Benneton Renault</b> followed in
            third and fourth places. This was short lived as
            Berger, demonstrating new found set up modifications,
            took Hakkinen on lap four and started his charge to
            catch Schumacher. By lap 10 Villeneuve had a
            commanding 10 second lead and looked set to control
            the race from the front. Team mate <b>Heinz Harald
            Frentzen</b> continuing his disappointing qualifying
            performance, dropped from 8th to 13th position while
            Hill grabbed two places at the start, to run 7th for
            the early part of the race.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By lap 12, Berger
            managed to pass Schumacher on his second attempt at
            what became the only realistic passing point, at the
            end of the pit strait leading to the Senna S&#146;s.
            Retirements came for Barichello on lap 16 with rear
            suspension problems and <b>Pedro Diniz</b>, who spun
            off a lap later suffering from severe oversteer. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuve was now 9
            seconds ahead of Berger on lap 20, followed by
            Schumacher, Hakkinen, <b>Jean Alesi</b>, and <b>Olivier
            Panis</b> driving a magnificent race for the newly
            formed<b> Prost</b> team in the highest of the
            Bridgestone runners. David Coulthard, in the second
            McLaren and the winner of the Australian Grand Prix,
            pushing Hill for 7th place, was finding it hard to
            pass and was the first to stop in an effort to use
            the <i>&#145;pit lane passing manoeuvre&#146;</i> and
            use some clear air on his exit to make up some time.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both Benettons pitted
            by lap 23 and subsequently after Villeneuve and
            Schumacher had also stopped on lap 26. Olivier Panis
            was up to second and Hill to 4th, the Bridgstone
            tyres performing brilliantly. This enabled strategies
            for both drivers to run on only two sets of tyres for
            the race thereby halving their visits to the pits.
            These had happened by lap 36, Panis Pitting three
            laps earlier and Hill, after being passed by both
            Schumacher and Alesi on their charge to make up
            ground, made a 12.4 second stop and rejoined in 11th
            position.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Apart from a brief
            period when Berger led the race at Villeneuve&#146;s
            2nd pit stop, The Canadian was not to lose the lead
            again. By the second round of stops, Panis had
            managed to hold onto a solid third place having only
            pitted once and Hill losing oil pressure, was passed
            by Villeneuve on lap 63, yet another new experience
            for the Arrows driver who had earlier been overtaken
            by the lagging Frentzen. But Berger seemed to
            struggle at times and through no fault of his own,
            Hill slowed the Austrian down in his late charge to
            catch Villeneuve. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Irvine in the spare
            Ferrari had made an unscheduled pit stop to have his
            seat belt loosened. The spare car, set up for Michael
            Schumacher was not a good fit for the Irishman. <i>&quot;On
            the grid we were unable to adjust my belts properly
            as the straps were too short, &quot; he said later,
            &quot;The pain was so bad that I had to come in to
            have them adjusted by having one side undone and the
            other done up. I had a cutting pain all through the
            race, especially under braking when it felt as though
            my leg was being cut off.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
            src="dco97aa.jpg" width="384" height="256"></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Coulthard could not
            better 10th, having managed to squeeze passed Hill
            and it must have been frustrating seeing his team
            mate Hakkinen a country mile ahead in 4th place.
            Having said before the race with more than a little
            over confidence, that, if he stayed on the track he
            should be in the points thereby remaining at the head
            of the driver&#146;s championship, after the race
            conceded, <i>&quot;It was a hard race battling to get
            passed Damon whilst keeping others behind me. I am
            amazed that so many people finished! Normally if you
            can stay on the track you can get in the points and
            win some races, but today everybody had
            reliability.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Three laps before the
            end and with a not discreditable 11th place secure,
            Hill&#146;s oil cooler caught fire and he headed for
            the pits. As the car was covered in white foam Hill
            seemed in no hurry to get out of his car and
            commenting afterwards he did not seem unhappy about
            his afternoon&#146;s work. <i>&quot;It is always
            disappointing when you get so close to the end of the
            race and don't make it to the finish, but I think
            that things are a lot better than in Melbourne.&quot;
            </i>He said, <i>&quot;I saw I had low oil pressure
            and as I was coming up the hill, I lost drive. It was
            pretty terminal.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuve took the
            flag a little over four second ahead of Berger,
            opening up the account for Team Williams. Panis also
            opened Bridgestones account with four championship
            points. This could prove to be a significant victory
            as it proved that the tyres are all that they were
            cracked up to be and should leave Goodyear a little
            worried. If both Hill and Panis could run with such
            heavy fuel loads on soft compound tyres for over half
            the race and still be relatively competitive then it
            is only a matter of time before the top teams will
            start to reconsider their contractual obligations
            with the US tyre giant. Michael Schumacher talked for
            most of the Goodyear drivers when he said after the
            race, <i>&quot;Just as I expected our tyres did not
            maintain their performance level over the whole race.
            I had a job getting past Hill as his tyres were still
            in top condition. This lost me time which probably
            cost me one or two places.&quot; </i>Ferrari sporting
            Director added, <i>&quot;Our decision to use hard
            tyres did not bring the advantage we expected.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jarno Trulli</b>
            driving to a creditable 12th position in his Minardi
            also gave Bridgestone the plug, <i>&quot;We went for
            a one stop strategy and we were right: the
            Bridgestone tyres are really impressive. After my pit
            stop I started to push hard to get better position
            since my car was working well. By the end of this day
            I get the satisfaction to have left behind me a
            Ferrari, a Prost and two Tyrrells cars... It's not a
            bad result, is it?&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Speaking post race,
            Berger could not help mention his tyres too, <i>&quot;I
            started my fight with Schumacher and it was not
            easy... it cost me a lot of time and tyres!&quot; </i>He
            said, <i>&quot;After I passed Michael I started to
            push behind Villeneuve. I wish I could have really
            put him under pressure towards the end but I got
            stuck behind some cars, like Hill's, losing time and
            wearing tyres, so I just couldn't do it! But my
            second place is good enough for now...&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="msa97aa.jpg" width="384"
            height="256"></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Only five cars failed
            to finish a race of sheer physical hardship. Most
            drivers were wearing neck restrainers for the
            anticlockwise course and there will probably be some
            sore muscles this week. Hill put in a superb
            performance extracting a creditable display from a
            car that finally looks as though it might achieve
            results towards the end of the season. It is also on
            the cards that Panis will see a lot more podiums this
            season and Prost has definitely established itself as
            the most up and coming of the second string teams.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Frentzen yet again
            failed to deliver and what Frank will do remains to
            be seen. Talking after the race Chief Engineer<b>
            Patrick Head</b> echoed the thoughts of a lot of
            people in the pit lane,<i> &quot;Relative to Jacques,
            his performance was not strong. We&#146;ve got to
            have a chat with him about this.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuve was serene
            in his victory and it really didn&#146;t seem to
            stress him at all. <i>&quot;Once I'd passed Michael
            Schumacher, I was in control of the race. All I had
            to know was make sure none of my opponents came back
            at me. I'm Satisfied.&quot; </i>He said<i>. </i>The
            road seems strait for Jacques to the Champions crown.
            However, a few kinks here and there would make the
            inevitable a little more interesting for us all.</font></p>
