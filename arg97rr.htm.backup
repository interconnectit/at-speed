            seems that the young <b>Olivier Panis</b> having been
            bestowed with unerring pearls of wisdom from Guru,
            team boss and four times world champion&#146; <b>Alain
            Prost </b>and the emotional <b>Rubens Barichello,</b>
            fathered and molly-coddled by &#145;Dad&#146; <b>Jackie</b>
            in the upstart <b>Stewart Racing</b> team, have both
            given the Formula one fraternity the novel prospect
            of mid-running teams threatening to take over the
            positions in the traditional latter half of the top
            four. It just goes to show, that if you treat your
            pets right they will reward you in the end. With
            extremely poor showings from both <b>McLaren</b> and <b>Benetton
            </b>in qualifying, the grid for the <b>Argentinian
            Grand</b> <b>Prix </b>is peppered evenly with the
            &#145;grand&#146; and the &#145;not so grand&#146;.
            The tyre war that looked so benign in Melbourne, is
            gradually developing into a critical factor in the
            final positioning on the grid and even allowing for
            the supersonic capabilities of the <b>Williams FW19</b>&#146;s,
            the decision to use soft <b>Bridgestone</b> rubber by
            both Stewart and Prost, has undoubtedly given them a
            distinct advantage. The choice of a hard <b>Goodyear</b>
            compound by the Benetton team and a time over two and
            a half seconds slower than <i>&#145;pole
            meister&#146;</i> <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>
            illustrates this point well. <b>Gerhard Berger</b>
            said after qualifying 12th, a mere 3 hundredths of a
            second in front of the wayward <b>Arrows</b> of <b>Damon
            Hill</b>,<b><i>&quot;</i></b><i>I think that first of
            all, we made the wrong choice of tyres. During the
            session the sun disappeared and it got a little bit
            cooler. Therefore, it would have been better to run
            on soft tyres&quot;</i>. Technical Director<b> Pat
            Symonds</b> agreed but, trying to explain his
            mystifying decision to take the &#145;hard&#146;
            line, he said,<i> &quot;We decided that we wanted to
            run on hard tyres, a decision which is always going
            to give you some disadvantage in qualifying. But we
            hope that it might give us a chance to catch up
            tomorrow in the race.&quot;</i> This however, proved
            to be the wise choice as, with a track temperature
            climbing from 31 degrees at the start to over 35 by
            the finish, the softer compound Goodyears began to
            blister.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hard or soft tyres,
            light or heavy fuel loads, one, two, or three pit
            stops, the mix was perfect and, as the red lights
            went out, Villeneuve&#146;s Williams predictably made
            a perfect dash for the first corner. The Canadian,
            suffering as Hill did last year, from <i>&#145;a
            severe dose of the trots&#146;,</i> was clearly keen
            to get the race over so that he could resume his
            enforced relationship with the bathroom. Still, true
            to form, the coming together of Carbon fibre was
            inevitable. This time it was the other red Ferrari.
            Rubens Barichello in the Stewart making a good
            getaway, was harried into the long right hander by <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b> trying to dive down the inside.
            Understeering badly he careened wide and into the
            Stewart Ford. <i>&quot;I got off the line ok and was
            running wide at the end of the straight to keep out
            of trouble,&quot; </i>Said Barichello afterwards, <i>&quot;but
            suddenly I just felt a touch on my rear wheel, so I
            presumed that was Schumacher. It took me off - I spun
            and lost the nose cone.&quot;</i> Schumacher sensing
            a red flag situation sprinted back to the pits with
            the hope of re-starting in the spare car. The race
            was deemed yellow however and the Safety car was
            brought out and an extremely angry German disappeared
            into his motor home. In the ensuing mayhem, cars were
            diving for the dirt and any piece of grass verge to
            avoid the carnage. Separate accidents occurred when
            the other Stewart of <b>Jan Magnussen</b> had a
            collision with the <b>Sauber Petronas </b>of <b>Nicola
            Larini </b>and the <b>West McLaren</b> of <b>David
            Coulthard</b> lost a wheel in a brush with <b>Ralf
            Schumacher&#146;s</b> <b>Jordan Peugeot</b>. <i>&quot;Either
            Hakkinen or Coulthard touched me on the right tyre
            with his wing.&quot; </i>He said, <i>&quot;I thought
            he had destroyed it, but I was lucky.&quot;</i>
            Coulthard wasn&#146;t lucky and echoed his
            premonitions back in the pits, <i>&quot;I expected
            something in the first corner but not this.&quot;</i>
            The Benetton of Berger did not escape either. Taking
            to the dirt, he was pushed to the back of the line, <i>&quot;I
            got involved in the accident and basically I started
            the race from the end&quot;</i>, he said later.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With a painfully slow
            pace car keeping the snaking bunch in check, thoughts
            of Imola in 1994 came to mind (when <b>Ayreton Senna</b>
            crashed and died immediately after a similar
            situation involving a slow pace car) and as tyres
            cooled and engines overheated on a track that was
            rapidly warming up, it was imperative that the race
            got underway with the shortest possible delay.
            Frentzen having lost a full two seconds in the first
            lap after suffering clutch engagement problem at the
            start of the warm-up lap, was now back on
            Villeneuve&#146;s tail and ever watchful for the
            lights of the pace car to go out.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lap 4 saw the race
            resume and by lap 5, Frentzen was coasting to a halt
            with his Drivers Disengagement System malfunctioning
            again, leaving him with no drive and once again no
            points. Olivier Panis was boiling now and, looking to
            catch Villeneuve&#146;s Williams, started making
            initial gains of three tenths of a second a lap.
            Unusually, Irvine had stayed clear of the fracas,
            choosing to collect dirt on his tyres rather than
            tangle with a slow starting Frentzen. <i>&quot;I was
            half alongside Frentzen and I couldn&#146;t overtake
            him. I didn&#146;t want to stay out that wide, so I
            had to back off and pull in behind him, because I was
            out in the dirt. That slowed me down for the first
            couple of laps,&quot;</i> He said later,<i> &quot;as
            the fuel came off and the tyre pressures came up, the
            car came good.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile the Jordan
            twins of Ralf Schumacher and <b>Giancarlo Fisichella </b>were
            making extremely good progress behind the front three
            and looking strong for a double point tally. By lap
            14 both Panis and Villeneuve had traded fastest laps
            and track records and it was clear that this weekend
            at least the Frenchman was getting the better deal
            out of Villeneuve&#146;s Stomach bug.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Damon Hill, again
            driving magnificently in 7th place in a car quite
            frankly not fit for the track, having had no time for
            any form of set-up due to a water leak during
            Saturday qualifying, was keeping his head down and
            holding off an agitated Jean Alesi and it was set in
            stone that he would have a crazy crack at passing
            Hill at the earliest opportunity. This he did on lap
            16 in a pointless and premature manoeuvre that left
            them both spinning in the dirt on both sides of the
            track. They both got away, with Hill losing 4 places.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lap 18 saw the
            cruellest retirement with Olivier Panis cruising to a
            halt with a hydraulic fault. A faultless drive such
            as his should have been rewarded with a podium finish
            but it is only a matter of time now before this
            resurgent Honda/Panis combination comes out on top.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first of the pit
            stops were made on Lap 22, Villeneuve pulling out of
            the pit lane barely a car's length in front of
            Irvine&#146;s Ferrari. The Ulsterman was to pit a lap
            later, in turn handing second place to a charging
            Giancarlo Fisichella. The battling Jordan
            &#145;chums&#146; obviously wanting to make their
            off-track coolness a touch chillier, managed to get
            entangled a little further round the bend. In a
            futile attempt to find space on the inside at turn 3
            Schumacher knocked his teammate for six, sending him
            spinning out of a well deserved 2nd spot. Young Ralf
            showing uncomfortably similar traits that his older
            brother Michael demonstrated throughout the &#146;94
            season arrogantly dismissed any concept that it could
            have been totally his fault, <i>&quot;He(Fisichella)is
            very angry now and I understand this, as the mistake
            was my fault.&quot; </i>He could have left it at that
            but added a rather barbed,<i> &quot;He made a mistake
            in the corner before the back straight, and I thought
            he really opened up the gap, and then he closed the
            door. We have to talk about that later.&quot;</i>
            Pity poor innocent Giancarlo who until then had not
            put a foot wrong. Down the road, Rubens Barichello
            was shutting up shop for the day and must have been a
            great disappointment for Jackie Stewart after such a
            promising drive. <i>&quot;I lost a mirror,&quot;</i>
            said a continually optimistic Rubens, <i>&quot;It
            came into the cockpit and as it had a cable on it, I
            had to pull hard to get rid of it and lost a lot of
            time. Then I just lost the hydraulic pressure. A pity
            because today would have been a podium, not just
            points.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile Alesi was at
            it again scrabbling past Hill and going wide,
            allowing the World Champion to retake his position.
            Alesi put it down to gear shift problems <i>&quot;I
            started to have problems shifting down: the gears
            locked and this made me go straight into the dirty
            parts of the track. I had constantly to try to clean
            my tyres.&quot; </i>This did not prevent him from
            doing a fastest lap however and to spare him further
            aggravation, Hill retired his car on lap 33-his 3rd
            DNF in a row. <i>&quot;I got an overheating problem
            and then I lost air pressure which meant ...the
            engine broke and I had to stop.&quot;</i> He honestly
            didn&#146;t seem to care although he probably did.
            Along with team mate <b>Pedro Diniz,</b> who retired
            with another blown Yamaha 17 laps later, he
            hadn&#146;t had a good weekend. An underachieving
            chassis, an engine with no power and a lot of human
            error on the team's part, is no great advert for the
            seemingly redoubtable reputation of <b>Tom
            Walkinshaw&#146;</b>s outfit. It says much for
            Hill&#146;s skills as both driver and diplomat that
            he has not yet walked away in disgust.<i> </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the second pit
            stops up and coming and both front Bridgestone
            runners out of the race, the result seemed like a
            forgone conclusion but with a track temperature
            approaching 35 degrees, Williams Renault having
            elected to use the softer compound Goodyears, was
            starting to have major handling problems. <i>&quot;We
            chose the wrong tyres.&quot; Said Villeneuve
            afterwards, &quot; With more rubber on the track
            towards the middle of the race we suffered
            understeer, consequently blistering the tyres, so it
            was very difficult to keep the others behind. We
            planned to do three stops but were not expecting
            anyone to do one, so were a bit surprised and it
            almost caught us out.&quot; </i>Villeneuve&#146;s
            second pitstop left Eddie Irvine to run free in first
            place for six laps before he made his second stop.
            Schumacher in the Jordan benefiting from the
            &#145;hard&#146; choice of tyres and a single pit
            stop, was easily outrunning the straggling 3 pack of
            Herbert, Hakkinen and Berger by over 15 seconds who
            in turn were all linked overall by barely 2 seconds. </font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The position was not
            to change and as Irvine gave up his lead in the pit
            lane, Villeneuve managed to put enough distance
            between him and the Ferrari to maintain his lead
            despite a third &#145;splash and dash&#146; stop. In
            the final six laps with Villeneuve nursing his tyres
            to the chequered flag Irvine put on a charge that
            briefly brought the race back to life and at one
            point was less than a cars length from the
            William&#146;s rear wing. <i>&quot;I was under his
            wing coming out of the last corner,&quot;</i>
            explained Irvine, <i>&quot;but he left me for dead on
            the straight. I was on the limiter going accross the
            start-finish line and there was no way I could
            overtake him unless I just barged into him.&quot;</i>
            In view of what happened at <b>Melbourne</b>, that
            would probably give Villeneuve full licence to murder
            the Irishman but luckily commonsense prevailed and
            the two cars crossed the line a mere nine tenths of a
            second apart.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the top six
            places going to six different constructors and the
            introduction of the <i>&#145;Bridgestone
            factor&#146;, </i>it is now becoming obvious that the
            lions of yesterday are not able to pick off their
            pray with the consummate ease with which they used to
            do. There is less room at the watering hole, now that
            the small teams are pushing to slake the thirst that
            so many dry seasons have brought on.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A final word can go to
            <b>Eddie Jordan </b>who&#146;s Jordan Peugeot team
            has survived 100 races and has still yet to quench
            his thirst for glory. <i>&quot;I have mixed feelings
            about today&#146;s result, as we could have had more
            points. But it is fantastic to be on the podium and,
            perhaps more importantly, to see that we have a car,
            an engine and tyre combination which is capable of
            running at the front. My neck is on the block, but I
            think it will turn out OK. It is a good way to
            celebrate our 100th Grand Prix. A podium finish is
