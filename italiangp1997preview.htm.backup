            size="2" face="Arial">The expectations of the<i>
            tifosi </i>this year more so than last, will be high.
            The <i>Grand Prix at Monza</i>, traditionally the
            place where all the rumours are laid to rest
            regarding driver placements, should be as closely
            fought off the track as on. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The only safe bet for
            next year, seems that <b>Michael Schumacher</b> will
            be driving for <b>Ferrari </b>again. The key piece in
            the jigsaw of driver's musical chairs is <b>Damon
            Hill</b>. When he sits down, everyone else will begin
            to move. With Ron Dennis announcing last week that he
            intends to keep his two <b>McLaren</b> drivers <b>David
            Coulthard</b> and <b>Mika Hakinnen</b>, Hill's
            chances of a competitive drive have taken a downward
            turn. A seat with the <b>Jordan Peugeot</b> team is
            possibly available, provided that star turn <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b>'s currant 'on loan' contract is not
            recognised by the <b>FIA</b>'s contracts board. This
            would put him firmly with <b>Benetton</b> under a ten
            year management deal with team boss <b>Flavio
            Briatore</b>, a team that the young Italian is
            reluctant to go to, having tasted the sweet smell of
            success with <b>Eddie Jordan</b>'s seemingly
            friendlier team. If Jordan were to retain Fisichella,
            then there could be a place available with <b>Benetton</b>,
            Briatore having ditched both <b>Gerhard Berger</b>
            and <b>Jean Alesi</b> in favour of young and cheap,
            wunderkind <b>Alexander Wurz</b> and one other. To
            add to the confusion Alesi has already offered his
            services to Jordan for a million pounds and that is
            considerably less than Hill's perceived asking price
            of seven million. Jordan however has had Alesi before
            and the Mercurial Frenchman has only one race win to
            his credit <i>(with Ferrari in Montreal)</i> whereas
            Hill has 21 and has the experience of winning which
            is an all important ingredient for a team hungry for
            victory. Although thought to be non-committal, Jordan
            said last week that, &quot;It would be a brave man
            who turned down a world champion.&quot; Whether this
            was a backward way of saying, &quot;Damon. reduce you
            price and we can talk..&quot; or not, no one but
            Jordan is sure, but it is thought that main sponsor
            Benson &amp; Hedges would be prepared to cough up an
            extra 4 million to secure Hill's services. <b>Jarno
            Trulli</b>'s place as second driver to the already
            confirmed <b>Olivier Panis</b> at Team <b>Prost</b>
            is for similar reasons, in doubt, but his 'loan'
            contract from Minardi and again, Briatore, should be
            easier to break if the right amount of money changes
            hands. Prost represents the last ditch for Hill and a
            final choice between staying put at <b>Arrows </b>or
            a year's sabbatical would be his only other option.
            Monza should sort all these variables out, but if
            not, Hill will find himself in the same predicament
            as last year, having just been ousted by <b>Williams</b>
            and on a dwindling market for a competitive drive.
            The result was a season of frustration and changing
            fortune for the World Champion.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If Michael Schumacher
            can keep the form that he showed in Belgium two weeks
            ago, then we can be sure of a spectacular finish to
            the race. This will however, not necessarily come
            from the drivers but from the <i>Tifosi</i> - the
            fervent Ferrari fans who will invade the track in
            their thousands should a red car pass the chequered
            flag first. Schumacher has every chance of achieving
            a second win on <b>Ferrari</b>'s home turf in two
            years and with the collective passion of a hundred
            thousand fans rooting him on, the scenario looks
            favourable for complete chaos as the chequered flag
            falls. Woe betide the stragglers trying to make up
            points. They will be hard pushed to make it to the
            line let alone the pits.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Opened in 1922 in the
            grounds of Monza Royal Palace, the <i>Autodromo
            Nazionale</i> was an awesome 6 mile combined road and
            oval circuit with huge banked concrete curves at each
            end. It has also claimed the lives of over a dozen
            racing drivers including <i>Ascari</i> in 1955, <i>Wolfgang
            Von Trips</i> in 1961, <b>Jochen Rindt</b> in 1970
            and <i>Ronnie Peterson</i> in 1978. It has also
            claimed the lives of over 40 spectators. After 3
            drivers were killed on the same day in 1933 the oval
            circuit was abandoned until it was restructured in
            1955 with revised but still venerable banking. The
            only part now used is the pit strait past the
            original grandstands, leading to the spectator
            friendly chicanes at <i>Rettifilio Varlante</i>,
            where the original <i>North Curve</i> swept away
            right, into a long banking curve. Tantalising
            glimpses can still be seen as the cars thread their
            way through the chicane to the <i>Curva Grande</i>.
            The cars appear from the trees in the final part of
            the deceptive Parabolica and pass the point where the
            old South Curve banking used to feed onto the pit
            straight.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last year saw the
            first of Hill's chances at clinching the championship
            title, end in a collision with some temporary tyre
            barriers at the <i>Goodyear chicane</i>, erected
            ironically at his own suggestion, to prevent drivers
            cutting the corners and dislodging lethal concrete
            slabs of curbing.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Having pulled out a
            commanding lead over Alesi by lap six and driving
            with skill and determination, maybe his exuberance
            got the better of him and he smacked 'those tyres'
            with his right front wheel. His car made a fine
            pirouette and came to a standstill mid track at the
            exit to the chicane. <i>&quot;I just have to admit to
            making a mistake&quot;</i> he said later, <i>&quot;There's
            no one to blame except myself. That was probably
            quite an easy race victory and I threw it away&quot;.</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The magic came back to
            Monza as Schumacher took the flag and the crowd
            exploded with joy. <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b> came in
            over a minute and a half down and one lap behind.
            Team boss <b>Frank Williams</b> must have wondered
            where it all went wrong, knowing that his cars should
            have outpaced the field.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This year, although
            Williams are still regarded as the main force, it has
            not gone their way and it is only by dint of good
            fortune and with a few lucky wins for Villeneuve,
            that the championship is still in contention.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fisichella has a race
            win in his sights and buoyed by his second place in
            Belgium and a car that will be one of the fastest on
            the long straights that Monza provides, Schumacher
            could have an unexpected fight on his hands. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hot weather has not
            been kind to the Scuderia this year suffering as they
            have been with tyre problems, but with a better
            handling lightweight chassis and the Germans
            undisputed driving abilities a win looks more than
            likely. It could even be the underachieving <b>Heinz
            Harald Frentzen</b> that will do the honours for
            Williams this year. Villeneuve has said that their
            chances in Italy don't look good.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This year with
            Schumacher mellowing and Ferrari on a high from
            Belgium, the fans, amassing at what they call <i>La
            Pista Magica</i>, will be as passionate as ever. The
            Iron bars that surround the paddock - where normally
            wire fencing would do in all other tacks, will be
            swamped with passionate Tifosi, some armed with bolt
            cutters, all desperate to touch the hand of their
            hero who can restore their faith in the Prancing
            horse and the grandeur that was once Ferrari.</font></p>
