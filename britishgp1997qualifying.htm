            the 32nd British Grand Prix took place on a warm <i>Silverstone

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Team boss <b>Tom
            Walkinshaw</b>&#146;s outspoken and negative comments
            regarding Hill&#146;s motivation and lack of
            performance has set the pit lane alight with opinion
            as to the timing of his remarks.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Starting will a less
            than veiled threat to Hill&#146;s continued
            association with the team, Walkinshaw said, <i>&quot;We&#146;re
            at the time when we are seriously considering our
            drivers for next season and his performances speak
            for themselves. It&#146;s quite obvious to any one
            who has been watching the team closely that we
            aren&#146;t satisfied.&quot; </i>He went on,<i>
            &quot;We&#146;re not satisfied with his performance
            and nor should he. He has had too many accidents,
            particularly in the early laps and he hasn&#146;t
            been qualifying as he should.</i> Citing recent lap
            times showing that Brazilian &#145;pay&#146; driver <b>Pedro
            Diniz</b> has on occasion shown a faster turn of
            speed than Hill, Walkinshaw continued, &quot;<i>We
            recruited him as one of the fastest two or three
            drivers around to lead the team, not for us to have
            to motivate him. We have the right to expect him to
            show he&#146;s the lead driver in the team.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was some pit
            lane speculation as to whether Hill should feel
            threatened by Walkinshaw&#146;s comments or in fact
            be jubilant that at last, he has an excuse to leave a
            team that indeed promised him so much and gave so
            little. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Walkinshaw was
            obviously frustrated by the decision by <b>Mugen-Honda</b>
            to reject his own application for their power supply
            and award a two year contract to the </font><a
            href="http://www.at-speed.co.uk/smn/f1jots97.htm"><font
            size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jordan</b> </font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial">team. Probably more than a
            little embarrassed too, knowing that the Japanese
            engine manufacturer, having had an eye on the
            Arrows&#146; recent performances decided that Jordan
            was by far the better bet, he made some concession to
            his damnation of Hill&#146;s talents by saying, <i>&quot;The
            non -performance has been split 50-50 during the
            course of the year by the team and the driver, but
            there comes a time when you have to stop being subtle
            and now it&#146;s time to be blunt.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">These comments will
            have damaged Hill&#146;s confidence in his team
            though, probably remembering similar comments made
            about him by former employer <b>Frank Williams</b>,
            he says not. <i>&quot;Frustration is evident not only
            in drivers, but also in team managers. Tom is
            entitled to put a rocket up the bum of his drivers. I
            have had much worse criticism from other team
            managers in the past.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Treading a line
            between his usual diplomacy and the determination of
            the downtrodden, he suggested that because <i>&quot;one
            of the better engine deals in the paddock went to
            another team,&quot;</i> it had not helped
            Walkinshaw&#146;s quest for more horsepower for next
            year. <i>&quot;I am not keen to draw comparisons
            between the package represented by Tom and what we
            actually have. It would not be wise for a situation
            to evolve where one party starts to claim that
            another party is not pulling their weight. We are all
            in this together.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some observers saw
            Walkinshaw&#146;s comments as an act of &#145;Sour
            Grapes&#146; in the light of the Leafield team not
            being able to live up to the promises that were made
            for it at the beginning of the season. At a time when
            Hill would be talking to any number of teams
            regarding a drive for next year, Walkinshaw, realises
            that without a competitive engine (and it seems now
            that a TWR developed</font><a

            size="2" face="Arial">are his only options), his
            chances of retaining the World Champion are less than
            Zero. Hill offered the laurel leaf to Walkinshaw, no
            doubt with a nettle in the other hand by saying, <i>&quot;My
            goal is to get back into the hunt for the
            Championship and I&#146;d like it to be with Arrows,
            if they can offer me the right package.&quot;</i> It
            now seems probable that they can&#146;t and with some
            dozen or so drivers expected to change places next
            season, it would indeed be the right time for Hill to
            start looking to sign the right piece of paper.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill&#146;s
            performance rating has indeed been poor this year but
            with a few exceptions it has been entirely down to
            the team. Whether one qualifies first or last, if the
            engine expires one does not finish the race. The list
            of incidents makes for unhappy reading.</font></p>

            damaged his front wing forcing lengthy repairs and a
            finishing position of last. Walkinshaw&#146;s
            suggestions that Hill <i>&quot;went of the track in
            France unaided&quot; </i>was uncalled for. He may not
            have touched another car, but had he done so trying
            to keep himself on the line he would have not only
            wrecked his own chances of even a miserable finish
            but someone else&#146;s too.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill does have support
            in the pit lane, strangely enough from his ex
            employer Frank Williams. <i>&quot;Clearly he is
            struggling with his car, but we all know he is a
            World Champion.&quot; </i>He said.<i> &quot;He&#146;s
            won 21 races and that&#146;s all you need to
            say.&quot; </i>Whilst not suggesting that Hill would
            find a place back in his team next year, Williams did
            add, <i>&quot;If circumstances come together I would
            re-employ him, he&#146;s a great driver.&quot;</i>
            It&#146;s a pity that Walkinshaw doesn&#146;t see it
            that way.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After managing a mere
            20th position on the grid in untimed practice on
            Friday, Hill fared a deal better today. Driving his
            socks off in a late charge, he gained 5 places on
            team mate <b>Pedro Diniz</b> to finish in 12th
            position sharing the grid with 11th placed <b>Benetton</b>
            driver <b>Jean Alesi</b> who in turn was three places
            down on rookie replacement driver <b>Alexander Wurz</b>.
            It seems too, that earlier pep talks from his team
            boss <b>Flavio Briatore</b> have amounted to nothing
            and that he will be looking for new pastures at the

            team mate <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b>. <i>&quot;I

            despite some brilliant car control was barely able to
            coax his Ferrari under the 1.22s mark and had to be
            content with a second row 4th place.<i>
            &quot;Overall, I am quite happy and this is the
            position I expected. Starting from the second row
            suits me well.&quot; </i>He said<i> &quot;The car has
            improved since yesterday, but it&#145;s not as good
            as it was last week during testing. Tomorrow I shall
            try to maintain a good lead over Villeneuve in the
            Championship by taking as many points as possible. It
            is almost impossible to pass on this track if others
            do not make mistakes but I hope I can make it to the
            podium.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Team mate <b>Eddie
            Irvine</b> had earlier hit a hare that ran into his
            path. Explaining his 7th place on the grid, he said, <i>&quot;I
            got a big fright on my first quick lap when I hit a
            hare. I was forced to pit to check over the car and
            change tyres. We put more downforce on, but as I was
            short of time I was not able to check what effect
            this had before going for a quick lap. I think the
            race will be very tough, as it will be difficult to
            maintain a very quick pace.&quot;</i></font></p>

            over half the session but had to make way to

            minutes. A stunning lap by Villeneuve followed almost
            immediately knocking just under two tenths of a
            second from the German&#146;s time to give the French
            Canadian pole position and some indication of his

            brief floor-pan fire erupted on his return to the
            pits. Poor Barichello&#146;s final run was in <b>Jan
            Magnussen</b>&#146;s car which also suffered engine
            problems and he had to abandon it on the circuit. <b>Alan
            Jenkins </b>Stewart technical director said, <i>&quot;As
            yet we don&#146;t know the cause of all the problems
            we met today, except that they all appear to be
            engine related.&quot;</i> He went on to say how
            Galling it was as the problems <i>&quot;follow on
            from a very successful operation of re-adjustment and
            tuning of the chassis to meet changing track
            conditions. A time of 1.2s seemed very much on the
            cards.&quot;</i> The Brazilian will start from the
            last row of the grid in 25th place.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The equilibrium is has
            now been maintained. A Williams lockout, the first in
            a few races, with the threat of Schumacher&#146;s
            Ferrari just behind. Villeneuve should not harbour
            any complacency tomorrow, as not only the three
            Germans will be hungry for his points, but the Flying
            Finn&#146;s McLaren could well figure in the
            fighting. There are indeed too many possible
            conclusions these days and judging by
            Villeneuve&#146;s recent past, no one would put even
            money on him to win. One of Coulthard&#146;s
            legendary starts could upset the apple cart on a
            circuit that is not renowned for its overtaking
            opportunities. Young Schumacher and Fisichella both
            have the power to do damage and could be considerably
            quicker than the Ferrari&#146;s. Safe to say the
            black and white helmet of Damon Hill will not be
            contesting the lead no matter how many kicks in the
            backside Walkinshaw meets out. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a sweeping
            statement, Walkinshaw said <i>&quot;any professional
            is only as good as his last race. You should be
            trying 110% to show other they should want you.&quot;</i>
            Hill always does his best and it would only be
            expected of the team to give him the best tools to do
            the work. He hasn&#146;t got them this year but there
            is not a team on the grid that has not noticed him
            trying.</font></p>
