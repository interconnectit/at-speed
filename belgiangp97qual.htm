            size="2" face="Arial">The action on the track at <i>Spa-Francorchamps</i>
            took a poor second place in the eyes of the press to
            the news of <b>Ron Dennis&#146; </b>decision to
            retain his two <b>McLaren</b> drivers for next year.
            In a statement issued at Spa yesterday (22nd), Dennis
            said <i>&quot;Both drivers have contributed to the
            building and re-shaping of our team and I believe
            that they should and will benefit from the fruits of
            these efforts next year.&quot; </i>Dennis&#146; offer
            of a salary of £1.3 million for current World
            Champion <b>Damon Hill</b> to drive for him plus a
            bonus of £650,000 a win, did not settle easily on
            Hill&#146;s shoulders. Hill probably quite rightly,
            thinks that he is worth more than that. In a
            statement issued after Dennis&#146; announcement Hill
            said that the offer, <i>&quot;did not accord with
            what I had been led to believe from our prior
            negotiations and I did not consider that it
            demonstrated a serious commitment to me as a
            driver.&quot;</i> Be that as it may, the choices for
            Hill are now, as last year, rapidly running out. With
            his rejection of a $20 million deal with <b>Sauber,</b>
            over two years, signifying his desire for action with
            a more competitive team, it is therefore strange that
            he should turn down, admittedly a paltry offer with <b>McLaren</b>,
            but more importantly, the chance of winning races in
            a team that looks highly likely to be amongst the top
            three next season. &quot;<i>The reason those deals
            have been put to me is because of my ability and
            achievements in the sport and what I can do for a
            racing team.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;Nobody would
            be offering me money if I was no good. It&#146;s not
            about risks we take, it&#146;s because of our huge
            commercial value. Sponsors want to be associated with
            Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill. It&#146;s not
            right for me to roll over with my legs in the air and
            forego the things I have worked for all my
            career.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This leaves Hill with
            few options and whilst he does not believe that it is
            a buyer&#146;s market, his only hope now of a
            competitive drive is with <b>Jordan Peugeot</b>. But
            then both <b>Jean Alesi </b>and <b>Gerhard Berger</b>
            are on the market with few places in the top half of
            the grid remaining. Hill told the <i>London Evening
            Standard</i> on Friday, that he already knows where
            he is headed for 1998 and that he couldn&#146;t say
            anything for a few weeks. If so, why was he so
            forthcoming regarding his rejection by<b> McLaren</b>?
            The even money is now, that he will stay put and try
            to develop the <b>TWR</b> <b>Arrows </b>team. True,
            the car has improved in leaps and bounds over the
            past few months and with ex-Ferrari <b>John Barnard</b>
            on board and with the new &#145;narrow&#146; specs
            coming in for next year, the goalposts have been
            widened for all the teams but unless there&#146;s a <b>Mecachrome
            Renault </b>lurking under the covers, no matter how
            good the car is, the <b>Yamaha</b> will not cut it
            this side of the millennium. But in all probability,
            unless he goes with Jordan or the extraordinary
            happens and <b>Williams</b> take him back, his career
            will not take an upturn at the end of 1997 or 1998
            for that matter. His fees will be a great deal less
            than this year and the sport will see the talents of
            one of the more experienced and reliable drivers on
            the grand Prix circuit, squandered.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Qualifying by
            comparison was a mere aside. <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>
            popped out of the pits after about 15 minutes to take
            provisional pole by half a second from <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b> eschewing his lightweight chassis for
            the heavier spare car. The first few minutes of the
            session saw six changes of pole position, starting
            with an early benchmark set by J<b>ohnny Herbert</b>&#146;s
            <b>Sauber </b>followed by Jean Alesi who was
            extremely quick in the wet the previous day, <b>Heinz
            Harald Frentzen</b>, <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b> and
            Schumacher.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite an extremely
            serious accident in the morning warm-up, when <b>Mika
            Hakinnen</b>&#146;s <b>McLaren </b>broke a carbon
            fibre toe-link control, he was back in qualifying
            ending up an excellent 5th. <b>David Coulthard </b>on
            the other hand, struggled all session suffering from
            severe understeer, doing well to get 10th slot.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Damon Hill, again
            driving with all of his trademark smoothness, was at
            one time 4th but subsequent fast laps by <b>Ralf
            Schumacher</b>, Fisichella, Alesi and his own team
            mate <b>Pedro Diniz</b>, pushed him down to 9th
            position, a reflection on the speed of the track
            rather than his driving. It must however, have been
            irksome to him to be out-qualified by his number two
            driver Diniz and it is clear that the
            drivers&#146;-seat war has put his mind, if only
            temporarily, elsewhere.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <b>Jordan Peugeot</b>&#146;s
            flew and again Fisichella showed what a superb young
            driver he is. On pole, however briefly, he drove
            brilliantly and with maturity, ending his day 4th, to
            share the grid with the man he so nearly overtook in
            Hungary, <b>Michael Schumacher</b>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A late charge from
            Alesi in the final 90 seconds, failed to reclaim his
            pole position and he had to settle for second best in
            what could turn out to be a fruitful weekend for him.
            Team mate <b>Gerhard Berger</b> had an
            &#145;off&#146; at the <i>Bus stop</i> chicane
            earlier in the session and driving the spare, set up
            for Alesi, couldn&#146;t get passed 15th place. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Irishman <b>Eddie
            Irvine </b>was unable to go higher than 17th
            position, his Ferrari suffering from balance and
            understeering problems.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If it rains tomorrow,
            the <b>Bridgestone</b> runners will be following the
            leaders a great deal more closely, but it looks as
            though <b>Williams</b> have finally got their act
            together and produced a car that today was by far the
            nimblest and seemingly Villeneuve had more in
            reserve, as he looked like a man that was barely
            trying. <i>&quot;This was a good one.&quot;</i> He
            smiled. <i>&quot;It&#146;s always good to be quick at
            this track. We hardly changed the set-up all
            day.&quot;</i> Ho hum. With confidence like that it
            is hard to believe that the promoters haven&#146;t
            already threaded the maple leaf flag above the
            podium. Whilst the Ferrari&#146;s may not have the
            legs for the course, especially in the heavier
            configuration, it could be the fabulous Jordan&#146;s
            that will do the running and Fisichella in particular
            who could be the snake in the grass.</font></p>
