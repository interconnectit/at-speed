            <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>All things equal in
            qualifying for 6th European Grand Prix</b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In yet another
            surprise in a season full of surprises, the top three
            qualifying times for the final race of the Season in <i>Jerez</i>,
            Spain, this weekend, are identical. The chance of
            this happening in any competitive sport against the
            clock is rare, but with lap times measured down to
            thousandths of a second the occurrence of two, let
            alone three identical times, must be a million to
            one. As President of the <b>FIA, Max Mosley</b> put
            it, <i>&quot;Measured in tenths, you might expect it
            every 150 years or so, but in thousandths, well we
            thought that </i><b><i>Bernie Ecclestone</i></b><i>
            had something to do with it!.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">F1 boss
            Ecclestone&#146;s wishes have come true. He said
            yesterday, <i>&quot;The perfect scenario now is to
            have them both on the front row of the grid and see
            them battling all the way to the chequered
            flag.&quot;</i> This has indeed happened in the most
            dramatic way possible.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was clear that <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b>&#146;s team mate <b>Eddie Irvine</b>
            had succeeded in getting under <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>&#146;s
            skin by some irksome blocking tactics during the
            morning warm up session. This prompted a lightning
            visit to the <b>Ferrari</b> pits by the diminutive
            Canadian and some serious finger pointing, helmet to
            helmet confrontation and meaningful looks. Villeneuve
            clearly irritated by the situation commented, <i>&quot;He
            did it to me four times this weekend, so I went and
            told him to stop being an idiot. We all know he is a
            clown and he does not think like any of the other
            drivers. He is not involved in this championship
            scrap and he should stay out of it.&quot; </i>Villeneuve
            in a final aside said, <i>&quot;Irvine just makes me
            laugh.&quot;</i> To which the sprightly Ulsterman
            replied, <i>&quot;He wasn&#146;t laughing
            earlier!&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With a stiff breeze
            and track temperatures rising, Villeneuve was the
            first to set what would be the fastest lap of the day
            at 1.21.07s, in his first of four runs and to clinch
            his 10th pole of the season. Both the <b>McLarens</b>
            put in early quick times and for a while looked as if
            either would be in contention for pole. <b>David
            Coulthard</b> and <b>Mika Hakinnen </b>were both
            briefly into second spot on their first runs with
            Schumacher following some 4 tenths down.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;It was really
            quite a troubled session.&quot;</i> Said Coulthard. <i>&quot;There
            was definitely a quick time to be had from the car,
            but the 2 runs in the middle, I hit a bit of traffic.
            It&#146;s the same for everyone and you just have to
            make your gap.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">An early spin by <b>Jean
            Alesi</b> already in the spare car after spinning out
            in the warm up, put him down in 20th position and he
            did well to recover to finish 10th overall. The
            Benettons failed yet again to realise their potential
            as team mate Gerhard Berger, driving his last race
            for the team and probably for himself as he enters
            retirement, did his level best to mix it at the
            front, finishing in 8th position. Whilst engine
            supplier Renault may possibly get a win, they
            certainly will not go out with a full podium for
            their last race in Formula 1, as the team now under
            new management look for the time being at least, to
            be on the ragged side of disjointedness.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just before half time
            and with a decreased downforce setting on his rear
            wing to counter balance the wind, Schumacher posted
            an equal time to Villeneuve passing yellow flags
            brought out by a spin by his younger brother Ralf. At
            first thought to be waving, there were fears of
            instant disqualification, however the track officials
            deemed the flags to be stationary but blown by the
            breeze. It seems destined that Michael&#146;s brother
            should be of such a great influence on his
            performances this year, for a split second loss of
            concentration undoubtedly cost the German that final
            one thousandth of a second that would have put him on
            pole. However it was not to be and as Villeneuve set
            the time first that was to be Schumacher&#146;s lot
            to start behind his arch rival.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;The start is
            going to be crucial.&quot;</i> Said Schumacher. <i>&quot;Doing
            a good one brings me into the first corner in the
            lead. If the start doesn&#146;t work that well, I am
            going to be stuck behind Frentzen.</i> <i>It is
            certainly a different sort of feeling for me from the
            two years with Benetton,&quot;</i> he added, <i>&quot;but
            it makes no difference at all once I am in the
            car.&quot;</i> Referring to a late charge by <b>Damon
            Hill</b>, he laughed. <i>&quot;The problem is that I
            am now surrounded by Williams drivers!&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <b>Ferrari </b>of
            Irvine having posted early fast times, was now
            struggling and could manage no better than 7th in the
            final count and reversing the positions in Suzuka,
            Heinz Harald Frentzen put in a final shot at pole
            with ten minutes remaining to record incredibly the
            same time as 1st and 2nd placed drivers. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All the teams with the
            exception of <b>Jordan-Peugeot</b> opted for the soft
            <b>Goodyear </b>compound, as did the <b>Bridgestone </b>runners
            with the exception of <b>Stewart Ford</b>. Qualifying
            times for all four cars were notably slower, however
            as most teams will probably opt for a three stop
            strategy for the race, it would enable the hard
            compound runners to gain some extra time by only
            stopping twice. Indeed a poor performance by the
            Jordan team resulted in the teams worst qualifying
            performance of the season. One thing that has
            remained constant, however, is the fact that the two
            drivers will start close to each other albeit down
            the field, <b>Ralf Schumacher</b> in 16th and <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b> in 17th places.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With less than a
            minute to go, both Schumacher and Villeneuve put in
            their final bids, but with the track speed dipping
            with the increasing temperature the early times set
            stood. A surprise lap by <b>Damon Hill</b> driving
            his last race as World Champion, put him onto the
            second row of the grid a mere 600ths of a second
            behind the fastest time. <b>&quot;I am happy,&quot;</b>
            He laughed. <i>&quot;but to look at the time set and
            see that I missed pole position by half a tenth of a
            second - and I know that I lost a lot of time with
            the Minardi that spun on the last corner- I&#146;m
            kicking myself, but it&#146;s great to be up
            there.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Seeming to have
            regained his composure after his pre qualifying
            wobbly Villeneuve was amazed that zero thousandths of
            a second separated the first three places and joked, <i>&quot;If
            you weren&#146;t here, you probably wouldn&#146;t
            have believed that it had not been done on purpose!
            It makes for a great last race.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As Damon Hill
            commented, <i>&quot;The Championship comes down to a
            single race&quot;</i> If Schumacher wins then he will
            have done it through his own raw talent for taming an
            unruly car. But if Villeneuve wins, everybody will
            say that it was only expected and he should have done
            it anyway as he has the superior machinery. Each must
            fight his own personal battle and as they sit in
            their cockpits seconds before the lights go out it is
            possible that the race has already been won and
            capitulation is but 150 metres away.</font></p>
