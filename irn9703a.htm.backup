        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Story by James
            Beckett.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>MARC GENE</strong>,
            the 1996 Italian SuperFormula Champion, is close to
            finalising a test and race programme with a leading
            Indy Racing League team.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Gene, 22, who lives in
            Buckingham England, and Barcelona, Spain, has been
            searching for a ride in the IRL since the end of
            November and his quest has just been boosted by the
            signing of a sponsorship deal with to major Spanish
            companies.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;These deals have
            happened just at the right time, &quot; Gene said
            this week. &quot;It has been a hard struggle to gain
            any backing from companies, although my last year's
            sponsor, Quaker State, have always planned to aid my
            budget.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Two tests for Nordic
            Racing in a Formula 3000 car have kept Gene on his
            toes during the closed season, although he must
            prepare himself for something of a culture shock as
            he heads to America and the famed oval speedways.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Driving on an
            oval will be so very different from anything I have
            ever done before. I am really looking forward to the
            challenge and I am confident that I can be a
            success,&quot; Gene added.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Originally it was
            hoped that Gene would make his IRL debut at the
            Phoenix International Raceway, round four of the
            1996/97 season, on March 23<sup>rd</sup>, although it
            now looks likely that his debut will take place at a
            test session in April at either Las Vegas or
            Indianapolis.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Prior to racing in the
            IRL Gene will have to take and pass a 'rookie test'
            governed by the American organisational body, USAC.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The four part test
            must be completed in controlled conditions under the
            watchful eye of USAC officials. When they are
            convinced of a driver's capability of driving on an
            oval track, the driver in question is granted a
            licence to race IRL.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A representative of
            USAC said this week, &quot;Marc Gene will sail
            through the rookie test. A driver of his standard
            will be a major gain to the Indy Racing League as it
            continues to establish itself in the motoring
            world.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If Gene's maiden IRL
            drive is a success then the possibility still stands
            that he may make a racing debut in the Indy 500 on
            May 25<sup>th</sup>, the 81<sup>st</sup> running of
            'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing'.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Aside from racing in
            IRL, Gene will also contest selected rounds of the
            FIA International F3000 Championship. Two teams,
            Nordic Racing and Coloni, are keen to sign him for
            the 1997 season and a deal looks set to be completed
            within the next fortnight.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The F3000 season kicks
            off at Silverstone on May11th, although a major
            pre-season test takes place at the Northants venue on
            April 23<sup>rd</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Throughout the entire
            season Gene will be wearing crash helmets
            manufactured by Japanese company Shoei.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Shoei America, based
            in Yorba Linda, California, recently signed a deal
            with Gene to cover him for 1997 and beyond. A Shoei
            spokesman said, &quot;Marc is a great driver and we
            look forward to supporting him in 1997. Racing in
            both IRL and F3000 we are confident he will win races
            and that is good not just for him but us also.&quot;</font></p>
