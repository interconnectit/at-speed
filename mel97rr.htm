            size="2" face="Arial"> wonder if <b>Damon Hill</b>,
            World Champion of 1996 had ever envisaged sitting
            behind not one, but two <b>Minardi Fords</b> at the
            start of a Grand Prix. Has he ever practiced a start
            from such a lowly position and will his reactions to
            the red lights prove to be a bit too quick for the <b>Tyrell</b>
            of <b>Mika Salo</b> in front? The ignominy of his
            position, proclaimed by the colourful gaggle of cars
            stretching before him, does not seem to have dulled
            his enthusiasm for wanting to put, what has been
            likened in the nicest possible way, as a
            &#145;dog&#146; , through its paces. It was testament
            to his driving skills and the mark of a true Champion
            that he managed to qualify his car at all. Now, safe
            with the knowledge that &#145;Number 1&#146; cannot
            be taken away from him, his often repeated assurances
            of loyalty to the team in the face of such appalling
            technical weakness, have not diminished in sincerity.
            His constant desire to prove himself as &#145;a great
            driver in a car other than a Williams&#146; will
            provide him with the motivation for attempting to
            skip this particular millstone across what will
            become a lake of increasing turbulence as the season
            progresses. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was therefore,
            perhaps significant, then that the <b>Arrows</b>
            never made it past the starting lights. A throttle
            failure during the warm up lap saved Hill from an
            inevitably embarrassing finishing position in what
            could only be described as a fitting and final
            scenario to the end of a miserable weekend for <b>Tom
            Walkinshaw&#146;s Arrows</b> team. Hill&#146;s final
            understatement of the weekend and there have been
            many, was: &quot;We&#146;ll have to go away and do a
            lot more testing&quot;. He did not sound unhappy,
            just resigned.</font></p>

        <em>Frentzen discusses his options</em></font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the lights went out
            <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>&#146;s getaway was
            uncharacteristically poor leaving the way for <b>Heinz
            Harald Frentzen</b> to hit the clear air first. The
            Canadian need not have worried unduly, for a fast
            moving <b>Irvine</b> edged his <b>Ferrari </b>up the
            inside to the right hand Turn one as <b>Herbert</b>,
            lively off the mark, started to pass the <b>Williams</b>
            on the left. This gave Villeneuve nowhere to go but
            into Herbert&#146;s<b> Sauber</b> forcing both into
            the gravel and out of the race. Irvine never made it
            to the end of the first lap, retiring with damaged
            suspension. In quick succession, as the German led <b>David
            Coulthard</b> and <b>Michael Schumacher</b> through
            the first couple of laps, younger brother <b>Ralf
            Schumacher</b> threw his Jordan away whilst Dutchman <b>Jos
            Verstappen</b> sent his <b>Tyrell</b> airborne over a
            kerb and hit the gravel. <b>Nakano</b> in the <b>Prost
            Mugen Honda</b> was next off, sliding on a grass
            verge and putting his nose firmly in the dirt. Six
            cars out by lap three and Frentzen with a light fuel
            load for a two stop strategy, was walking away with
            the race, the remaining Ferrari failing to make any
            inroads on Coulthard&#146;s flying <b>McLaren</b>. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lap 7 saw the first
            record broken at 1.32.56 by Frentzen who had taken
            out a commanding 14.4 second lead. The other McLaren
            of <b>Mika Hakkinen</b> having dropped off the pace
            slightly was being worried by the two Benettons who
            in turn were being pursued hotly by <b>Olivier Panis</b>
            in the highest of the Bridgestone runners. The new
            boys weren&#146;t having a very good time of it today
            and <b>Fisichella </b>in the other Jordan Peugeot
            took his car off trying to late brake <b>Rubens
            Barichello</b>&#146;s <b>Stewart</b> to gain 9th
            position. The deal with Peugeot for next season now
            just got a little further away.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By Lap 18 Frentzen was
            in amongst the back markers and was called in for
            fresh rubber handing the lead to Coulthard and
            rejoining in third behind Schumacher. It was
            surprising at this point that the expected gain the
            Williams should have made on the Ferrari was not
            apparent, the gap stabilising at around 8 seconds.
            With Coulthard making a new lap record of 1.31.41 on
            lap 29, things didn&#146;t look so rosy in the
            Williams camp.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lap 30 saw Schumacher
            into the pits for what was to be a misjudged stop
            giving Frentzen second spot, but with Coulthard ahead
            with a very useful 12.5 second advantage. The boards
            were out for <b>Jean Alesi</b> as Coulthard pitted on
            lap 32 and, on the Benetton&#146;s third pass, it was
            plain that the team were getting angry and the
            Sicilian&#146;s ornery streak was coming to the fore.
            By ignoring his instructions to pit, it was obvious
            that he was in a world of his own. Frentzen now the
            leader once again, but still to make a second stop,
            was again unable to capitalise on the clear track and
            pull out a few more seconds. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The inevitable
            happened of course and the luckless Alesi cruised to
            a halt with no fuel left on board. This unforgivable
            act of disobedience surely must seal his fate with
            team boss <b>Flavio Briatore</b> and it is now
            debatable whether he will see out the season with the
            team.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The final drama was to
            unfold has Frentzen took his second stop. The
            overheated brake discs caused a rear wheel nut to
            lock taking him 16 seconds to clear the pit,
            conceding first place to Coulthard and coming out
            third behind Schumacher. Yet again the gap between
            The Ferrari and the Williams failed to close
            significantly and as Schumacher made a second
            unscheduled stop for a &#145;splash and dash&#146;
            and new tyres it looked like the Williams would at
            least make the second step of the podium. This was
            not to be. On lap 55 with three to go, braking at the
            end of the pit straight for Turn One, Frentzen's left
            front disk let go in a cloud of black dust causing a
            rapid spin into the dirt and disbelief for the
            Williams team. The explanation for his lack of pace
            was now obvious.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A jubilant McLaren
            crew leapt upon Coulthard as he parked his car in the
            victor&#146;s parc ferme alongside 3rd man home and
            team mate, Mika Hakkinen. This was the 50th
            anniversary for a winless McLaren. The last victory
            being taken by <b>Ayrton Senna</b> at Adelaide in
            1993. An emotional <b>Ron Dennis </b>spattered with
            Champagne said in a faltering voice, &quot;When
            you&#146;re in the position we&#146;ve been in for
            the past two years and you can&#146;t get anything
            right and you get plenty of criticism and sometimes
            motivation is a little harder to find, it&#146;s
            satisfying to get the job done.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, a rather
            inauspicious start to the season for Williams and one
            that none of the experts would have predicted. Both
            Coulthard and Schumacher had Irvine to thank for
            throwing the race into chaos and providing a points
            table that initially at least, will not show a
            runaway and uncontested lead to a Williams
            championship. They will be back, that is without
            doubt and, as Hill may reflect on the plane home
            tonight, Boss <b>Frank Williams</b> may not get it
            all his own way this season. Unfortunately for Hill
            though, it will not be him showing him the way. The
            Arrows that won were silver not blue and white.</font></p>
