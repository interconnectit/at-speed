            face="Arial">mid the cacophony of <b>Total</b> oil
            drums being beaten into submission by a group of
            demented drummers and, as pit lane mechanics rolled
            away tyres that littered the floor, through the smoke
            and flashing lights, team owner <b>Eddie Jordan</b>
            today unveiled the car which he believes will take
            the <b>Benson and Hedges Total Jordan Peugeot</b> team
            all the way to the top in 1997. Looking rather serious,
            he made his way to the podium with his chief designer <b>Gary
            Anderson</b>, Peugeot Sport director <b>Pierre-Michel
            Fauconnier</b> and his two new drivers <b>Ralf
            Schumacher</b> and <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b>.</font></p>

            align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" width="180"
            height="190"></font><font face="Arial">Mindful of the
            &#146;96 season when the team finished behind the top
            four of <b>Williams</b>, <b>Ferrari</b>, <b>Benetton</b>
            and <b>McLaren</b> and with his focus set firmly on 1998
            when there is a distinct possibility that he may lose
            his exclusive contract with <b>Peugeot</b>, this has
            to be Jordan&#146;s make or break year. With a newly
            named <b>Team Alain Prost </b>- formally <b>Ligier</b>
            - waiting in the wings to pick up the the deal, he
            knows that he must produce the goods this year.
            &quot; I haven&#146;t felt the buzz for the last
            couple of years,&quot; He began &quot;we took a long
            hard look at the company and came to the conclusion
            that we were under-achieving, so we made a deliberate decision
            to invest the sponsorship which Benson and Hedges
            brought to us, upgrading our factory facilities and
            increasing the number of personnel at the team.&quot;
            He went on: &quot;The company roll-call has
            subsequently grown by 50% and the <b>Jordan-Peugeot
            197</b> is the result of a highly intensive Research
            &amp; Development programme, the like of which we
            have never been in a position to undertake
            before.&quot;<img src="jo97laac.jpg" align="right"
            hspace="5" vspace="10" width="180" height="123"></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Glancing across to his two
            young drivers both resplendent in sparkling new
            brilliant yellow race attire, he said, &quot;In
            Giancarlo and Ralf we have two young drivers who are
            ambitious and hungry for success, and I believe that
            the Jordan-Peugeot 197 is the car to bring them that
            success.</font><font size="1" face="Arial"> </font><font
            face="Arial">We want fireworks and I&#146;m sure
            that&#146;s what we are going to get.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Despite Anderson&#146;s
            statement to the effect that the 197 &quot;is
            principally an evolution of its predecessor&quot; The
            startling looks of the new car seem to suggest otherwise.
            Indeed when it&#146;s designer warmed to the topic of
            modifications and changes, the list seemed endless.
            &quot;The car does look quite different. &quot; he
            explained. &quot;The prime reason for the changes was
            aerodynamics. The 197 has shorter sidepods and we've
            made some changes at the rear of the engine cover and
            around the inside of the rear wheels&quot;. Having
            the luxury of a mid season start to their development
            programme has given <b>Jordan</b> time to collaborate
            closely with engine supplier <b>Peugeot</b>, in
            radically redesigning the air box. &quot;... to
            counter the problems everybody experienced last year
            with the drivers' helmets upsetting the airflow into
            the engine&quot;. It also gave them the time to
            develop the engine&#146;s performance and integration
            into the new chassis and also to take on board the
            opinions of the drivers. Anderson continued
            enthusiastically with his endless list of
            modifications: &quot;We've also modified the rear
            suspension to cope with the revised aerodynamic
            package, added carbon fibre front and rear top
            wishbones to comply with the new <b>FIA</b> specification,
            and the lower front wishbones are steel, with carbon
            fibre stiffening. Other changes include a new 7-speed
            longitudinal gearbox which has been redesigned
            principally for aerodynamic reasons, as the car is
            very narrow at the rear. Lots of other mechanical
            changes are not so obvious. Most of them are little,
            logical things to improve the handling over the
            bumps, and help look after the tyres.&quot;</font></p>

            align="left" hspace="5" vspace="10" width="220"
            height="173"></font><font face="Arial">Some package indeed
            and it is easy to see why Eddie Jordan commented wryly,
            &quot;Gary Anderson copped most of the budget.&quot; Anderson
            ended on a veritably up beat note that could almost
            be a battle cry and could leave some less confident
            teams in a state of severe uncertainty. &quot;These
            developments, combined with the aerodynamic
            improvements, have given us a massive amount more
            downforce. I don't want to be too specific, so I will
            just describe it as a very significant increase. In
            fact, in all my time in motor racing I have never
            seen such a big step forward as we have made this
            year.... &quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Looking desperately young and
            seeming none to used to the bedlam of the Press at
            bay, Eddie Jordan&#146;s two new boys sat quietly as
            if waiting for an interview with the headmaster. Both
            seemed suitably grateful for the chance to prove themselves
            at the top end of the sport, <b>Fisichella, </b>hoping
            to &quot;... pay them back with a podium finish&quot; and
            Schumacher, brushing the cameras away like flies,
            stated the obvious: &quot;Expectations from the team
            are a lot higher than the press&quot;. Depending on
            what you read of course, he could even be the next <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b>.<img src="jo97laae.jpg" align="right"

                    to begin an intensive testing programme prior to

            <p><font face="Arial">It seems that Jordan have
            really got the bit between their teeth this year and
            if this enthusiastic approach were measured in points
            then the Constructor&#146;s cup would already be in
            their boardroom. Gary Anderson meant it when he said, &quot;I'm
            not out to play any more - I want to win.&quot; Indeed,
            they just might.</font></p>
