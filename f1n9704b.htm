            confusion as to the colour of the flag that was
            raised above Eddie Irvine when he took the second

            in Northern Ireland had asked the FIA to raise a
            neutral flag, perhaps white and showing a shamrock.
            The FIA allegedly agreed but raised instead the
            Tricolour, the national flag of the Irish Republic.
            Had regulations strictly been adhered to, the Union
            Jack of Great Britain and Northern Ireland should in
            fact have been raised. Should Irvine ever get to the
            top step of the podium and the decision is taken to
            fly the Tricolour again then we could also be greeted
            with the strains of <i>'Oh Danny boy'</i> or<i> 'When

            April 17, 1997</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As reported in <b>Speed
            Motorsport News </b>earlier, former designer for the
            Scuderia Ferrari Team, <b>John Barnard</b>, has
            finally signed a deal with bosses at Maranello to
            take over <b>FDD</b>, <i>Ferrari Design &amp;
            Development,</i> the<i> </i>Guildford company they
            had build up over a five year period together, in UK.
            In a statement issued by Ferrari last week a
            spokesman said &quot;A final agreement has been
            signed yesterday between Ferrari and John Barnard to
            conclude the arrangements for the transfer of its
            English facilities.&quot; The company will now be
            called <b><i>B3 Technologies Ltd</i></b>. The
            statement concluded, &quot;The facility will continue
            to operate, totally autonomously in respect of
            Ferrari, in the field of specialist design and
            manufacture.&quot; 50 year old Barnard who was
            reluctant to leave England to work full time in
            Italy, is said to have paid Ferrari £800,000 and it
            is not thought that he will be involved in any future
            development with the team.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before Barnard's bed
            gets too cold, it is expected that a fresh deal with <b>Tom
            Walkinshaws TWR</b> team is in the offing, whereby
            the Leafield company will pay Barnard a design fee of
            3 million for development of the 1998 Arrows chassis.
            Barnard's inovative design approach is said to be a
            key factor in retaining the services of current
            driver and World Champion <b>Damon Hill</b>. His
            introduction of the semi-automatic gearbox to Ferrari
            in the late 1980s was adopted by all the teams until <b>FIA</b>
            rule changes outlawed 'driver aids' in 1994.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile, rumours of
            discussions with engine suppliers <b>Mugen Honda</b>
            and <b>Mecachrome Renault</b> are rife and it is not
            thought that the one year agreement with <b>Yamaha</b>
            will be extended. Walkinshaw said, <i>&quot;talks are
            still ongoing.&quot;</i></font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <b>Total Jordan
            Peugeot </b>team tested the fourth <b>JP 197</b>
            chassis at <b>Silverstone</b> on the 16th and 17th.
            Both drivers concentrated on differential and
            aerodynamic development and brake work in preparation
            for Imola. Progress was delayed however, by oil
            leaks, and steering problems and a spin at Club
            Corner for <b>Ralf Schumacher</b> who will continue
            to race in chassis number 03. <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b>
            will now race the new 04 version. The original
            chassis will be used at the Jordan factory on the
            'seven post' rig.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Whether or not the
            grevous misunderstanding has been settled, over their
            coming together at the Argentinian Grand Prix, has
            yet to be determined. Schumacher Jr does not speak a
            word of Italian whilst Fisichella speaks little or no
            English and not a word of German. Schumacher
            supposedly told the newspaper <b>L'Equipe:</b> <i>&quot;I'd
            like to have a chat with him, but he(Fisichella)can't
            string two words of English together.&quot; </i>After
            the Grand Prix however, things seemed to have
            resolved themselves.<i> </i>Fisichella said: <i>&quot;Ralf
            has apologised to me which implies he is admitting it
            was his mistake.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The cars depart for
            San Marino on Sunday 20th after a very short turn
            around time of only two days. <i>&quot;Now that the
            European season has started we will begin the set
            routine of a race every fortnight with testing in
            between.&quot;</i> Said <b>Eddie Jordan</b>,<i>&quot;It
            means fewer hours spent travelling and therefore more
            time spent working on the car, but with that comes
            increased pressure. After our Podium finish in
            Argentina we are all pushing for more good results. I
            now want to see both our drivers on the podium.&quot;</i></font></p>

            have been called in to wind up the affairs of the
            Lola Ford Team. Despite earlier hopes of finding a
            sponsor to enable them to compete at Imola it seems
            that for this season Eric Broadley's dream of having
            fully fledged Lola cars on the starting grid has been
            shattered. Only last week Broadley was hopeful of
            fresh finances, <i>&quot;I only know that things are
            looking good,&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;The company
            had a spot of financial difficulty, but there is no
            real problem.&quot; </i>It is understood that only
            the F1 arm of the company is involved. Production of

            Barcelona will see the Williams prototype 'narrow

            preparation for the new FIA rulings expected to come
            into force next year in a further attempt to slow the
            cars by reducing effective downforce areas. Nicknamed
            &quot;Skinny Lizzy&quot;, it is a modified '96 FW18D
            and will be driven by test driver <b>Jean-Christophe
            Boullion.</b> At 180cm, and 20 centimetres narrower
            on the rear width than the current specifications, it
            proved predictably slower than any of the other teams

            grooved tyres which will drastically reduce the speed
            for next season.</font></p>

            is opposed to the idea of these technical changes
            despite having signed the agreement under the
            'Concorde arrangement' and is set to try and convince
            other teams to stop the revisions. Both Ferrari and
            Williams have invested considerable time and money
            into the '98 specifications and Ferrari Team Director
            <b>Jean Todt </b>is understandably reticent about the
            possible consequences. <i>&quot;I don't know if the

            explained.<i> &quot;The decision was taken months
            ago, and nobody complained. You can't keep changing
            your mind.&quot; </i>Eddie Jordan surmised that at
            the end of the day, <i>&quot;The designers will come

            situation.&quot; </i><b>Ken Tyrell</b>, acknowledging

            long run, carried out in four 16 lap stints, was
            successfully completed without problem. The German
            driver, who during the warm up had done further work
            on improving the set-up of his car, covered a total
            of 94 laps, equivalent to around 444 kilometres, with

            is better than yesterday,&quot;</i> he said
            afterwards. <i>&quot;I like the engine, not just
            because of its power curve but also because of its
            driveability. I certainly want to use it for
            qualifying in Imola. As for the race, the engineers
            will have to decide as to its reliability, not just
            for the engine but for all the other components as

            worked on improving the set-up, and different types
            of Goodyear tyre, including those already used this

            had to gel, and Australia was one of the hardest
            races I've ever done. For a start, none of the
            packing cases arrived on time, and when they did they
            weren't finished! In the end, though, Australia
            proved that all the planning we had done could
            actually deliver the goods. It was bloody dIfficult,
            and we only managed a very few hours' sleep, but we
            got there.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Since then
            we've made a massive leap forward: parts are coming
            through faster, we're used to the cars now, and we're
            working well as a team - we must be, because we're
            finishing at midnight instead of six in the morning!
            Now, getting back into Europe, with our own trucks to
            work from, things should improve even further - it's
            like working from an extension of your
            workshop.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Having said
            that, Imola won't be easy: the paddock's a strange
            shape, a bit pointy at one end. which puts space at a
            premium, so we need to be there early to get our
            trucks in! Otherwise it shouldn't be a problem. We'll
            fly a few people out on the Wednesday to set the
            garage up, and the bulk of the team will follow on
            Thursday. The way race weekends are structured right
            now suits us very well, I must say; there are many
            circuits we've never been to, so having a whole day
            of free practice to get things up and running
            properly is very helpful. Two-day Grand Prix weekends
            would be fine, as long as it's from next year!&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also new to the
            circuit at Imola is rookie Stewart driver <b>Jan
            Magnussen.</b> <i>&quot;I haven't driven a Formula 1
            car at Imola, though I did an Opel-Lotus race there
            in '93. But the track's changed since then and it's
            mostly the corners they've changed that I remember!
            It's quite long, so it will be another physical test,
            but if I can avoid misfortune in practice and get
            lots of laps in again, we should be okay.&quot;</i></font></p>

            Ferrari to destabilise Eddie. We must be pragmatic. I
            was criticised for keeping him this year, but last
            season we did not give him enough support. He
            deserves to be judged in the normal way, but the
            season has just started. He has seven or eight races
