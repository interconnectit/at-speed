        F1?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;To be honest I am
        quite satisfied. I had some technical problems in the
        first few races but things have since got better. I have
        finished in the points several times <i>(Argentina,
        France and Britain) </i>and I have been on the podium
        once. I think these are good results for a new driver at
        this level.</font></p>

        size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>tarting one's career with a
        front running team like Jordan was difficult and risky
        for a young inexperienced driver when one considers the
        inevitable Pressures and responsibilities which fall on
        the drivers' shoulders and the need for them to Score
        good results?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">''Well to be honest no-one
        at the start of the season knew that Jordan would be as
        strong as it has been in some of the races. I thought
        that it was a perfect opportunity for me and I never
        really felt the weight of pressure. Frankly I am happy to
        be here and not elsewhere &quot;</font></p>

        size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>oming from Japanese Formula
        3000 how did you cope with the responsibilities which are
        part of one's arrival in F1?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You know that in F1
        the main thing is the pressure which you put on your own
        shoulders. Looking at the situation in an objective way,
        one must Judge my resuIts and not lose sight of that
        fact. Everything in F1 is new for me. There were the
        circuits and the way in which the team operates. Although
        I had met the people during the pre-season tests, it is a
        question of gaining confidence &quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b><i>O</i></b></font><font
        size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>bservers reckon you have an
        aggressive style both at wheel of the Jordan-Peugeot and
        also when you are not in the cockpit is that necessary
        for a young driver to win respect in F1?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Actually I do not
        see myself as an aggressive driver to be honest, I simply
        try to do the best job possible. For example on the race
        track I do not to let an overtaking chance pass me by if
        it presents itself. This is normal, it is simply a
        question of getting 100% of its car's potential. The
        style of a driver can also depend a lot on the handling
        of his car. Look at Michael for example at the wheel of
        the Ferrari. Last year and at the start of this season,
        he adopted a style which seemed aggressive simply because
        he had to drive the car at 110% in order to achieve
        anything. In such a situation a driver is flirting with
        the limits. Perhaps you can call it aggressive out
        sometimes it is a necessary style of driving &quot;</font></p>

        size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>hat do you think about your
        reputation for arrogance in the F1 paddock? </i></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I think that this
        comes from the reputation I had when I was in Formula 3.
        I do not know how it started. I do not think I am
        arrogant but I am trying nonetheless to change a little
        and adapt myself to the new world in F1. The only thing
        is that It is very difficult to struggle against a
        reputation once it is established whether that is
        justified or not - and that would be a lot of energy
        expended to achieve not very much.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b><i>T</i></b></font><font
        size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>here is no question that you
        have had problems at the start of this year with your
        Jordan team mate Giancarlo Fisichella. What is the
        situation between the two of you today ?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I think that the
        principal problem was that the team is running two young
        drivers who have everything to prove. Both want to beat
        the other, both want to win and get the team behind them.
        To gain respect and show that they are stronger than
        their team mate, Giancarlo and I have, no doubt made
        mistakes by being obsessed with each other's performance
        but with the help and advice of <b>Eddie Jordan </b>we
        have tried to calm things down a little and work together
        for the good of the team. I think that we now have a
        normal relationship. We are working together during race
        weekends and we are exchanging information,&quot;</font></p>

        size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>hat are the most difficult
        problems to understand and solve when you are a young
        driver discovering the complexities of Formula 1 racing?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">''Personally I am very
        interested in the technical and mechanical aspects of F1.
        I would say that the major problem facing a young driver
        in F1 is in the paddock. In F1 there are lots of
        Journalists and commercial interests. One has to be
        available for things other than the car and the race and
        it is not that easy to control or to accept.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b><i>I</i></b></font><font
        size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>s it a problem or an
        advantage to have the same name as the best driver in the
        world?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;listen, when the
        results are there the name has no importance. Clearly I
        am not able to escape the comparison with Michael but I
        feel that I have the right to be a little slower than he
        is for the moment.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b><i>H</i></b></font><font
        size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>ave you had the chance to
        discuss the racing with your big brother? Do you exchange
        information?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;No, not really even
        if it happens between us. When we get the chance to talk
        quietly with each other we prefer to talk about things of
        everyday life rather than problems at &#145;the
        office&#146;.&quot; </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The name Schumacher
        helped me, that is for sure but Michael did nothing
        directly. He half-opened the door but I organised a way
        though the door on my own. I was the one who spoke to
        Eddie Jordan it wasn't Michael. &quot;</font></p>
