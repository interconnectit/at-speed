        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Qualifying for the
            Hungarian Grand Prix</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Schumacher Dances
            to pole and Hill takes third by stealth</b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">They say that if you
            qualify in the top three places in Hungary, then
            statistically, you have a 33% chance of winning the
            race. Whilst the odds for <b>Michael Schumacher</b>,
            who took command of the qualifying session at the <i>Hungaroring</i>
            and never let go, are probably quite a bit shorter
            than this, <b>Damon Hill</b> who did a spectacular
            lap in the closing stages of the session can look on
            his chances of a win with a great deal more optimism
            than of late. <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b> again in a
            late charge, took the 2nd place slot from <b>Mika
            Hakinnen</b> who had been in good form for the best
            part of the session.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With a cooling track
            over the qualifying period, it was inevitable that
            times would decrease. It also seemed inevitable that
            the <b>Ferrari</b> would figure strongly and, fresh
            from the blocks, the fourth man out, nimble and
            balletic, danced to the quickest time and never
            looked back. No one waited for the dust to be
            cleared. Teams seemed desperate to take advantage of
            the cloud cover which, as it turned out stayed for
            the whole session reducing the track temperature by
            some 10 degrees.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even Schumacher&#146;s
            team mate <b>Eddie Irvine </b>looked rejuvenated and
            at one point it looked as if it might have been a
            Ferrari lock out, but further excursions by
            Villeneuve and Hakkinen made sure that this was not
            to be.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <b>McLarens</b>
            tried hard to disappoint and despite <b>David
            Coulthard&#146;s</b> manful driving, his brief 3rd
            was knocked down to 6th and then 7th and eventually
            8th by the burgeoning <b>Gerhard Berger</b>,
            desperately trying to find the form in the <b>Benetton
            </b>on this undulating track, that he displayed in
            Hockenheim two weeks previously.<i> </i>His final
            effort for a front row position ended 48 minutes into
            the session with a spin at turn 12.<i> &quot;I had a
            very good session until I spun.&quot;</i> Said Berger
            later. <i>&quot;It&#146;s a pity because the lap I
            was on was two or three tenths of a second quicker
            and I know I could have improved my time in the last
            two corners. I pushed too hard and I didn&#146;t want
            to lift off. I touched a kerb and the car just spun
            off.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite early quick
            laps <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b> found himself being
            pushed down the order by Coulthard, Berger and
            Hakinnen and throughout the session seemed ill at
            ease with his set up.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jordan</b> were the
            disappointment of the day. Unable to set their cars
            up to their liking, they were both hampered by
            problems. <b>Giancarlo Fisichella,</b> despite
            driving well, suffered from a lack of grip and was
            only able to manage 13th slot. A humiliation after
            his &#145;almost&#146; triumph in Germany. <i>&quot;I
            knew today&#146;s qualifying would be difficult as
            the car was &#145;nervous&#146; yesterday.&quot;</i>
            He said. <i>&quot;In the end the tyre choice cost us
            a place but we had blistering problems with the </i><b><i>Goodyear
            </i></b><i>sift compounds so this is why we chose
            hard. The up-side is that it me be to our advantage
            tomorrow in the race.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Team mate <b>Ralf
            Schumacher</b> didn&#146;t fare well either after
            setting times that only got him 18th place on the
            grid. A spin and an electrical fire forced him to use
            the spare car that was set up for Fisichella and
            suffering brake balance problems did well to improve
            on his time to finish 14th. He said afterwards, <i>&quot;
            I expected to be in the top six but we ran into
            technical problems. Although I improved a little it
            was impossible to make a real impact. There was a
            small fire but we don&#146;t know what caused
            it.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both <b>Rubens
            Barichello</b> in the<b> Stewar</b>t and<b> Johnny
            Herbert</b> in the <b>Sauber Petronas</b> posted
            identical times, Herbert setting his time first and
            putting him into 10th position.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With just minutes to
            go, the top guns were all back on the track. Frentzen
            clawing his way beck to within seven hundredths of a
            second of his team mate, but it was to be oh, so
            brief and humiliation was but a few moments away.
            Within seconds of each other, Schumacher consolidated
            his pole position for the third time with a
            definitive 1m.14.67s and Villeneuve, pulling all the
            tricks out of the Williams bag, stole the march on
            Hakkinen&#146;s fine second slot just under two
            tenths behind the Ferrari and knocking Frentzen back
            down to 5th.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;It&#146;s a
            very difficult track to overtake on.&quot;</i>
            Commented Villeneuve after the session. <i>&quot;Last
            year we did the first part of the race with Michael
            in front and me second it was fun. Hopefully with it
            starting this way - it will finish like last year
            too, then that will be good. The team has made big
            improvements since Hockenheim and after some more
            work tonight we intend to give Michael a run for his
            money It should be an interesting run down to the
            first corner - an interesting drag race!!&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A drag race it may be,
            but unless he is hot off the mark, Schumacher proved
            today that he is untouchable and the Canadian will be
            burning his rubber in a vain attempt to keep up with
            the Ferrari. <i>&quot;I made a small mistake on my
            quickest lap, but it did not affect my time.&quot;</i>
            Said Schumacher. <i>&quot;I made some small changes
            to the car before each run and they always brought an
            improvement. The cooler temperature helped me to
            improve, but not that much and the new chassis
            allowed me to run closer to the weight limit, which
            is very important on this track. The circuit is very
            difficult as you can never move off the racing line
            as you will end up in the dirt. Pole position is not
            the key to winning the race, as tomorrow we must
            choose the right strategy.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The surprise was still
            to come however, as the world watched Coulthard
            overcook it in his McLaren searching for those lost
            seconds, World Champion <b>Damon Hill</b>, driving
            with all the smoothness of the cream on a pint of
            Guinness, was on a blinder and it wasn&#146;t until
            the <b>Tag Heuer</b> timing charts refreshed
            themselves that we saw that Hill had placed himself
            barely half a second behind Schumacher&#146;s
            tailpipes in 3rd and on the clean side of the track.
            After maintaining positions of 12th and seventh in
            his first two &#145;outs&#146; his lap seemed to come
            from nowhere and Hill seemed as bewildered as
            everyone else. <i>&quot;Of course I&#146;m absolutely
            delighted but it was a bit unexpected&quot; He
            grinned. &quot;I thought I had a chance of making the
            top 10 or even the top 6, but third is truly
            fantastic.&quot;</i> Even through the PR speak that
            followed, he made the obvious point regarding his
            tyres. <i>&quot; My team have worked brilliantly and </i><b><i>Bridgestone</i></b><i>
            have got the tyre mixture just right.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With a track eminently
            suitable for the <b>Arrows</b> chassis and possibly
            responding to <b>John Barnard&#146;s</b> additional
            &#145;go faster&#146; tweaks, <b>Bridgestone</b>
            rubber must feature strongly in <b>TWR</b>&#146;s
            successful mixture. It could be too that with fewer
            pit stops tomorrow and a reliable <b>Yamaha V10</b>
            he could be in with a shout at a podium finish. That <i>would</i>
            be something <i>and </i>coming at the Grand Prix
            where he scored his first victory in 1993. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once again Team boss <b>Frank
            Williams</b> has been given further food for thought
            as to the wisdom of letting Hill go, for his
            replacement Frentzen with the best car in the world
            and with a 100 horsepower advantage still can&#146;t
            get by the tank that is Arrows.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With all the rumours
            circulating of clandestine meetings with <b>Ron
            Dennis, </b>this performance, whether he scores in
            the race or not, will no doubt have impressed the
            McLaren team boss. Maybe Hill decided that Hungary
            could be the shop window for the product that he
            wants to sell. In which case there should be a few
            bosses queuing up to buy.</font></p>
