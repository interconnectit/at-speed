            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the red lights went
            out the predestined events began to unfold like the

            size="2" face="Arial"> who, despite his much
            publicised practice starts at <i>Silverstone</i> last
            week, still couldn&#146;t get it right.
            Coulthard&#146;s silver dart left an unsettled
            Schumacher&#146;s side and finding all the gaps, both
            left and right of Fisichella and Frentzen, took off
            after the Canadian rounding the first right hander
            ahead, on the inside. He wasn&#146;t stopping to see
            if the way was clear and Frentzen, now gaining speed
            towards the end of the straight and drawing alongside
            Villeneuve, who was being pushed a little by
            Coulthard, touched his team mate briefly, but
            maintained station. In the confusion six cars trailed
            past him leaving the dazed driver in 9th with a lot
            of serious motoring ahead. <i>&quot;Jacques and I
            banged wheels together at the start as it was pretty
            tight. I think I made a better start, but I didn't
            want to take any chances going into the first corner
            and take anybody off - especially Jacques!&quot;</i>
            Said Frentzen. <i>&quot;Unfortunately I knocked the
            ignition off and although I quickly realised what had
            happened, by then there were many cars in front of
            me. I was pretty disappointed at that stage but step
            by step we made it back up.&quot;</i> Fate continued
            to play it&#146;s hand and the very thoughts that
            went through Frentzen&#146;s mind were far from the
            mental capabilities of <b>Ralf Schumacher</b> who was
            about to find himself embroiled in a similar set of
            events.</font></p>

            the outside of the bend and the three cars met with
            inevitable consequences. Fisichella had nowhere to go
            on the inside, Schumacher junior had nowhere to go in
            the middle and they touched but unlike Frentzen, he
            rebounded off the Italian&#146;s car and into his
            brother, launching his rear wheel over the top of the
            Germans head. He hit the gravel before his brother
            who, keeping it together drove back onto the track.
            With damaged steering and suspension, he was forced
            later, over rumble strips at the <i>Veedol Chicane</i>
            and effectively out of the race 2 laps later. Ralf
            Schumacher id also to face a steward&#146;s enquiry
            over a &#145;track crossing incident&#146; without
            being under the marshalls&#146; direction, zero
            points.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Never one to fully
            take the blame as he has illustrated several times in
            the past and reminiscent of his brother in times gone
            by, he said, <i>&quot;It was a normal start incident.
            I made my best start of my career so far and had
            moved up to fifth place. We all braked a bit late at
            the first corner and there was just not enough
            room.&quot;</i> He went on, <i>&quot;I was hit by
            Giancarlo, not on purpose and my car jumped up in the
            air, I hit Michael and we were all off. It was
            potentially quite dangerous, so I suppose we should
            be quite happy no one was hurt. The consequences were
            bad for our team and for my brother Michael.&quot;</i>
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Amazingly and despite
            some door slamming anger as the German saw his
            championship chances evaporate, Schumacher met the
            press later, calmly, giving the benefit of the doubt
            to his brother. <i>&quot;He was going for his own way
            on this.&quot; </i>He said. <i>&quot;There was
            Fisichella trying to overtake Ralf as well, and he
            just went too tight. I do not like to accuse anyone,
            but I did everything to get out of the incident and
            could not. It was an accident. These things can
            happen and that is motor racing.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hakinnen meanwhile,
            must have been smiling, as he gradually pulled out a
            lead over team mate Coulthard and 3rd placed
            Villeneuve. </font><a

            managing to avoid the first corner carnage, was being
            shadowed by Jean Alesi another lucky escapee some ten
            seconds behind. The not so lucky <b>Gerhard Berger</b>
            starting 2 places behind, was forced to take to the
            gravel to avoid the incident, dropping down the order
            to 8th. <i>&quot;I think I was a little
            unlucky.&quot;</i> Said Berger. <i>&quot;I managed to
            get around the first accident(Frentzen &amp;
            Villeneuve), but then the two Jordan cars collided
            and with Michael's Ferrari in the middle, I had to go
            left to avoid a big crash and ended in the grass. It
            was very difficult to get back on the track and in
            the mean time I lost a lot of positions. Slowly, I
            started to gain more, but lap times were very close
            and I could not do better than I did.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After Alesi, a long
            queue formed behind the Stewart of <b>Jan Magnussen</b>,
            driving the race of his short career and managing to
            keep the pack at bay without braking any rules. <i>&quot;It
            was hard to keep Hill behind me.&quot;</i> Magnussen
            said. <i>&quot;But it&#146;s a lot more fun to run at
            the sharp end and for two weeks in a row we have
            shown we are capable of it.&quot; </i>The Stewart
            team have demonstrated a steady growth in stature
            over recent races and despite airing their engine
            development failures in public, they have produced
            some superb moments. Sadly a broken drive shaft was
            to cause the early retirement of the young Dane on
            lap 39.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Pit stops for both
            Villeneuve and Hakinnen (who&#146;s team cleverly
            spotted that Williams were getting ready to pull
            their driver in), on lap 28, gave The Scot a
            temporary lead before he pitted 4 laps later. With
            4th placed Barichello some 34 seconds down, the Finn
            rejoined the race behind Coulthard and in front of

            until the latter half of the race, when he started to
            push and scored a fastest race lap of 1:18.805s.</font></p>

            20 points on offer, Schumacher has to finish 2nd or
            higher in front of Villeneuve to have any reasonable
            chance at the drivers title and as it looks as though
            Ferrari&#146;s form has definitely taken a dive over
            the passed two races, the two times champion has an
            almost impossible task on his hands. It must have
            been a bitter pill for the German to take seeing an
            opportunity wasted. The misfortunes of the McLarens
            could so easily have worked to his advantage as well.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The fact that </font><a
            href="http://www.at-speed.co.uk/smn/fe97sp.htm"><font
            size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ferrari</b>&#146;</font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial">s development programme was so
            successful leading up to the Belgium Grand Prix, more
            or less forced Schumacher into thinking that he had
            more than a chance at the crown. It was always
            Schumacher&#146;s belief that 1998 would be the year
            to challenge for the championship. If he were to win
            it this year and it now looks doubtful it would be
            Schumacher alone and not Ferrari that would deserve
            the accolade.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With a win in Japan in
            a fortnight&#146;s time Villeneuve would take the
            crown. He has massive experience from his F3000 days
            there and it should be an easier race than most for
            him to win. Last year he was forced out with a loose
            wheel nut, enabling Hill to go on to win the race and
            the Championship. Mindful of this, Williams will not
            be so careless this time around and whilst mistakes
            have abounded this year, it is still Williams
            championship to lose rather than Ferrari&#146;s to
            win.</font></p>
