            size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jacques Villeneuve</b> will
            be contesting the <i>Japanese Grand Prix</i> under
            protest of disqualification on Sunday, after not
            taking quite the definitive pole position that he had
            hoped for. Already competing under a one race ban
            suspended for 9 races from a similar misdemeanour at <i>Monza</i>,
            he was deemed to have ignored a yellow flag waved in
            the mornings warm up session when the Marshals were
            clearing <b>Jos Verstappen&#146;s</b> stricken <b>Tyrrell</b>
            from the track and disqualified. <i>&quot;I find this
            difficult to accept.&quot;</i> Said <i>Villeneuve</i>.
            <i>&quot;It&#146;s a blow now that we are fighting
            for the championship and It&#146;s the most difficult
            season I have been part of in any form of
            racing.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The appeal will be
            heard by the <b>FIA</b> court of appeal next week and
            should he lose, which is highly likely, then any
            points he gets today will be discounted. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Five cars also on the
            track at that point received the same sentence,
            suspended for 2 further races. However, drivers <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b>, <b>Johnny Herbert</b>, <b>Heinz
            Harald Frentzen</b>, <b>Rubens Barichello</b> and <b>Ukyo
            Katayama</b> are not under any penalties at present
            so all will be racing tomorrow.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This represents a
            severe blow to <b>Williams</b>&#146; chances of
            securing both championship titles this weekend.
            Technical director <b>Patrick Head </b>was none too
            pleased, but philosophical about the incident.
            Indicating that Villeneuve was undaunted by his
            predicament, he confirmed that the Canadian was
            determined to win the race, no matter what the
            outcome. He added that, <i>&quot;In the case of
            Jacques already being under a suspended ban, he might
            have been wiser to have made a deliberate point of
            slowing down but he didn&#146;t.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This opens up the
            battle for the Championship title and gives <b>Ferrari
            </b>driver <i>Schumacher</i> a distinct psychological
            advantage over the Canadian. With team mate <b>Eddie
            Irvine</b> putting in a brilliant drive for third, he
            has his back covered against any incursion that <i>Villeneuve</i>&#146;s
            team-mate <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen </b>may make from
            the third row. <i>&quot;I will try and help Michael
            for the Championship,&quot;</i> said Irvine,<i>
            &quot;which makes my job ten times harder as I have
            to think about both of us.&quot; </i>Flippantly he
            joked,<i> &quot;I hope to make the best start, pass
            both of them and then let Michael pass me!&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Under the threat of
            dark stormy clouds there was a rush for the pit exit
            as qualifying got under way. <b>Mika Hakinnen</b>
            continuing his brilliant form in the <b>McLaren
            Mercedes</b> showed the way with the first
            provisional pole time of 1:36.46s and even with
            Villeneuve and Schumacher both on the track making
            the first of their four runs, his time stuck for the
            first fifteen minutes of the session. An explosion of
            oil from the engine of <b>Rubens Barichello</b>&#146;s
            <b>Stewart-Ford </b>left oil spread over the first
            two corners and consequently lap times suffered until
            the slick had been &#145;driven away&#146; by other
            cars.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the threat of
            rain receding, Villeneuve gained the pole on his
            second run out, followed 6 minutes later by <i>Eddie
            Irvine</i> into second place. Schumacher&#146;s <b>Ferrari</b>,
            like his team mate&#146;s, seemed to run well on the
            thin rubber of the <b>Goodyear</b> soft compounds as
            the track temperature during the early stages was not
            critical and the German slotted in behind Villeneuve,
            3 tenths of a second up on the Irishman pushing him
            to third. A rising track temperature saw the end of <b>Ferrari</b>&#146;s
            competitiveness although Schumacher thought he could
            achieve faster lap times. <i>&quot;Maybe I could have
            gone a little bit quicker,&quot;</i> He said, <i>&quot;but
            I had too much understeer on my last run.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Bridgestone</b>
            continued to disappoint. With the accumulated data
            from constant testing at their home track, they were
            surprisingly uncompetitive. Using a special compound
            formulated for the circuit the choice was about
            evenly split between hard and soft, the harder
            winning through to give <b>Prost</b> driver, <b>Olivier
            Panis</b> the highest position for the Japanese tyre
            manufacturer, at 10th place.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Damon Hill</b>&#146;s
            performance was disappointing for the <b>Arrows</b>
            team, the inferior power of the <b>Yamaha </b>forcing
            the <b>TWR</b> team to make compromises with the
            downforce to enable the car to be at least
            competitive on the straight. It was therefore down to
            the driver&#146;s skill to pilot the cars safely
            through the corners and it was in those corners that
            the time was lost. Hill finished a lowly 17th, one
            place behind his ever improving partner <b>Pedro
            Diniz</b>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The session was
            stopped for fifteen minutes with five minutes
            remaining, when <b>Giani Morbidelli</b>&#146;s <b>Sauber</b>
            hit the tyre barriers. <i>Schumacher </i>was on his
            third run and about to start his quick lap but
            aborted his mission and returned to the pits, the
            stickers on his tyres still showing. The rush back to
            the track didn&#146;t produce any dramatic changes at
            the front of the grid. Villeneuve who was concerned
            over his slender pole position lead, was forced out
            with two minutes remaining, fearing the German would
            be on his tail. He failed to capitalise on his
            premature actions, when <i>Irvine,</i> trying for a
            better time in the dying seconds of the session, was
            put to the side of the track with a fuel flow problem
            prompting the yellow flags to be fluttered again.
            Schumacher, seemingly playing &#145;cat and
            mouse&#146; with his rival and looking like he was
            about to shadow the Canadian&#146;s every move, chose
            to stay in the pits. <i>&quot;I wasted my third run
            when the red flag came out and did not go out at the
            end of the session, because I saw that the yellow
            flags were out again.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;If
            I had done my quickest lap at that point, I would
            have lost that time..&quot;</i> Whether he talked
            about self preservation or &#145;gamesmanship&#146;,
            it was not noticeable on his countenance and one has
            to assume that it was indeed, as he said. <i>&quot;I
            saw all the cars were stopping and I knew it was
            going to be a mess and I would just waste another set
            of tyres.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was clear that <i>Villeneuve</i>&#146;s
            session had not gone the way he had hoped. Not
            withstanding his disqualification. An hour before the
            Stewards&#146; announcement he was guardedly
            confident. <i>&quot;I wasn&#146;t expecting the
            Ferrari&#146;s to be so close to us.&quot;</i> He
            said. <i>&quot;The bad thing is that my team mate is
            behind and he&#146;s not in there to help us.&quot;</i>
            Aware of the threat that the two <i>Ferrari</i>&#146;s
            present at the first corner, he continued, <i>&quot;We&#146;ll
            have to wait and see what Eddie does without having
            Heinz there to do the same.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As darkness descended
            over the pits, the <i>Williams</i> mechanics
            continued their work on setting up a car that they
            knew might not even garner a single point despite it
            winning the race, but, it had to be done. <i>The life
            of Jim Morrison</i>, Villeneuve&#146;s current
            reading material, is likely to remain unopened in his
            hotel room at the circuit tonight and Schumacher will
            be in his pits long after everyone else had gone
            home, briefing his engineers on the finest details of
            his lap performance. An extra tenth of a second here
            or there could make all the difference. But with the
            threat of disqualification for the Canadian and no
            matter what the outcome of the race, there will be no
            championship celebrations until the <i>FIA</i> have
            had their say next week. Spain could be the unlikely
            venue for the final confrontation for the
            victor&#146;s crown.</font></p>
