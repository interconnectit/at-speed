            <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Schumacher
            dominates French Grand Prix. Ferrari's superiority
            leave Williams wondering</strong></font></p>

            face="Arial"><b>ichael Schumacher</b> took the French
            Grand Prix by the scruff of the neck, shook it and
            deposited the remains in front of a bewildered <b>Williams</b>
            pit. Celebrating his third victory in 4 races, he put
            paid to pre race doubts as to his competitiveness by
            saying <i>&quot;Why does our car work suddenly? My
            predictions for this race were wrong and this was a
            convincing win. to take pole position and win the
            race, is the best you can do&quot;. </i><b>Heinz
            Harald Frentzen</b> finishing second was as perplexed
            as his team, having barely managed to keep the <b>Ferrari</b>
            in his sights. <i>&quot;I was astonished by
            Michael&#146;s speed at the start. I thought he must
            be on three stops instead of two because he was
            pushing like hell, he pulled away and it should have
            been the other way round, so I just let him go.&quot;</i>
            He said, <i>&quot;I was desperate for points before
            this race, but I&#146;m finding more tricks and
            it&#146;s getting better.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It took merely a few
            seconds after the red lights had gone out for
            Schumacher to power cleanly away and out of sight
            with Frentzen just about keeping station behind. With
            <b>Eddie Irvine</b> bridging the gap to 4th placed <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b> hotly contested by <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>&#146;s
            <b>Jordan Peugeot</b>, the front of the pack was
            largely to stay unchanged throughout the race.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It also took merely a
            few seconds for World Champion <b>Damon Hill</b> to
            exit the race temporarily, as he was squeezed from
            the back of the pack funnelling in to <i>Estoril</i>,
            the first right hander. Trailing across the gravel
            with a broken nose unit, he was forced to pit for a
            replacement fighting his way through the contents of
            a fire extinguisher that had been inadvertently set
            off in the Arrows pits. <i>&quot;I came out a lap
            down and got blue-flagged until I found my rightful
            place in the grid and pressed on from there.&quot;</i>
            Hill said afterwards. <i>&quot;I just wanted to
            finish really, and, we finished.&quot;</i> And so he
            did, last and three laps down. His humiliation now
            seems complete and he goes forward to <i>Silverstone </i>and
            his home crowd<i>, </i>not as a returning hero, but
            as the guy who used to drive for Williams.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By lap 15 Villeneuve
            was struggling to stay in the frame, 5 seconds behind
            Irvine and 20 seconds behind the leader. The <b>Benetton</b>s
            were faring no better, <b>Jean Alesi </b>working hard
            to stay ahead of replacement driver and novice to
            Formula 1 <b>Alexander Wurz</b>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first round of pit
            stops did little to alleviate the drudgery and it was
            only the onset of rain around the time that the
            second stops were due, that caused the race to come
            alive. Most drivers settled for fresh slicks as the
            rain was not severe enough to warrant the heavy time
            penalties of intermediate rain tyres, <b>Jarno Trulli</b>
            being the exception in the <b>Prost</b> who promptly
            started slipping down the order. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By lap 60 it was
            tipping down and the scramble started in the pits to
            get wets on both team cars. Schumacher took a brief
            turn onto the gravel as his slicks tried to keep a
            grip on the soaking track, but he was shrewdly
            observing Frentzen, his only threat for the top step
            of the podium. If Frentzen didn&#146;t pit neither
            could he and so the game of cat and mouse continued
            until the end of the race. Frentzen was a marked man
            in the Ferrari garage. &quot;<i>I was just watching
            to see what Frentzen would do.&quot;</i> Said
            Schumacher. Frentzen did nothing, but Villenueve
            pitted for wets having spun at the chicane, dropping
            down to sixth place and giving up his fourth slot to <b>David
            Coulthard </b>in the<b> McLaren Mercedes</b>, who
            again was driving a brilliant race. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher was on the
            last lap and on his way to the 25th Grand Prix win of
            his career equalling those of <b>Jim Clark</b> and <b>Niki
            Lauda</b>. A brave if foolhardy move by his brother
            saw him give Coulthard a fright as he passed him at
            the <i>Adelaide</i> hairpin and promptly spin on the <i>180
            degree</i> bend. Coulthard was far from pleased. <i>&quot;Ralf
            took a silly dive down my inside at the
            hairpin.&quot;</i> He said <i>&quot;I gave him room
            because I wanted to finish. He then spun in front of
            me.&quot;</i> Schumacher Junior saw things
            differently. <i>&quot;He&#146;s a bit unhappy, I hear
            about my manoeuvre. I&#146;ll have to talk to David.
            It was very slippery, like driving on soap. I saw the
            possibility there and it obviously worked, but I spun
            again.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fate was to deal
            Coulthard another cruel hand in the shape of Alesi
            and this time it was terminal. He was rear ended by
            the mercurial Frenchman in a braking mistake,
            knocking him out of the race and a certain two
            points. When asked what happened the Scotsman said
            through gritted teeth, <i>&quot;Alesi happened, but
            he has apologised, so I suppose that makes everything
            okay doesn't it?&quot;</i> He said later, <i>&quot;We&#146;ve
            seen it so many times from Jean. He can pass me
            fairly he can race me hard, but to barge into me is
            very disappointing. Today McLaren deserved a point
            and we didn&#146;t get it.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The silliness
            continued to the final corner . Villeneuve on a
            charge from his sixth position and desperate to stay
            in touch with the top three, made a desperate lunge
            at 3rd placed Irvine as he bought his Ferrari into
            the final <i>Lycee</i> turn. Realising that he
            wouldn&#146;t make it, the Canadian, braking heavily,
            spun across the track, over the curbing and into the
            pit lane entrance. <i>&quot;I had him covered, and
            then he wasn't there as I gunned for the line.&quot;</i><b>
            </b>A bemused<b> </b>Irvine said.<b> </b>With debris
            and superstructure flying from his car, he kept the
            engine alive and executing a 180 degree turn rejoined
            the track almost taking Jean Alesi out as he came
            steaming round the bend. A stewards enquiry later
            decided not to apportion blame on Villeneuve for the
            incident, but it was yet another example of a
            reckless approach that has been in evidence in the
            past few races and Williams Technical Director
            Patrick Head will no doubt be none too pleased.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A minute and 23
            seconds earlier, Michael Schumacher had taken the
            chequered flag at the same time, allowing his young
            brother to unlap himself and take advantage of
            Coulthard&#146;s plight by grabbing the point left by
            Alesi. <i>&quot;I was really lucky to get that extra
            lap from Michael and win a point. I owe him one, or
            perhaps this is my birthday present to me for
            tomorrow!&quot;. </i>Said a happy Schumacher Junior.
            Team boss <b>Eddie Jordan</b> was not so happy
            however. With a messy performance by the young German
            and a disappointing 9th place from an unhappy <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b> in an unprepared spare car due to
            engine failure, he said, <i>&quot;We cannot be
            remotely satisfied with winning only one point, but
            it is good that we are closing the gap on the other
            teams.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher&#146;s
            victory now gives him a 14 point lead over Villeneuve
            and will ensure that he goes to his home Grand Prix
            in Germany in three weeks time, the Championship
            leader. Ferrari too are showing Williams the way and
            the Didcot team will be scratching their heads and
            wondering why.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Never higher than
            fourth except for pit stops, Villeneuve revealed
            another tactical weather related error by his team
            when he said that his car had been prepared for rain
            and was difficult to handle throughout the race. But
            it&#146;s not that the Williams is particularly slow,
            it&#146;s the Ferrari that&#146;s now faster. With a
            redesigned front wing and the promise, from newly
            appointed Technical Director <b>Ross Brawn</b>, of
            further improvements to come, the <i>Scuderia</i> are
            set to be come the dominant force in Formula 1, a
            position that has up til now been the privilege of
            Williams to hold. Recent publicity regarding the
            outspoken Villeneuve and the physiological pressures
            put on Frentzen cannot have helped team moral and for
            once <b>Frank Williams</b> choice of drivers now
            seems marginally suspect.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The race was of course
            down to the driver and the driver was the class of
            the field. His superiority was evident from
            qualifying, to the flag and if the Ferrari improves
            further by mid season, it will be a hard struggle for
            Williams to catch this runaway horse.</font></p>
