            for fresh fields next season, shared the front row of

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A weekend, where all
            the talk was of <i>&#145;young blood&#146;</i>
            drivers, hungry for the spoils of their elders and at
            a fraction of the cost, amounted to just that: talk.
            The dinosaurs have roared back with a show of

            were, however, the aforementioned and it was only
            down to a rotten piece of luck that Fisichella
            didn&#146;t score a truly deserved 2nd place on the
            podium. <b>Michael Schumacher</b> again
            &#145;lucked&#146; in to higher position through the
            demise of the Italian, gaining a further six points
            on <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>, who, having a most
            unsatisfying weekend, lost interest in the race and
            gave it all away, mixing it with the back-markers on
            lap 33 and spinning out. With <b>Mika Hakkinen</b>
            balancing out the last podium step, two and a half
            seconds in front of another Italian rising star, <b>Jarno
            Trulli</b> and Jordan at least getting some return on
            a day of unfulfilled potential, with a disappointing
            fifth place for<b> Ralf Schumacher</b>, it was a
            &#145;feelgood&#146; victory for the Austrian,
            who&#146;s father died recently in a light aeroplane
            crash and no doubt, giving genuine pleasure to the

            size="2" face="Arial"> immediately started to pull
            out a gap which never really shortened. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Frentzen meanwhile
            starting from 5th place, took the long way round the <i>NordKurve</i>
            corner out of the stadium complex and Irvine, making
            the best start of his life, shot from tenth place to
            take the Germans 5th. Frentzen forced on to the grass
            by his own mistake and attempting to regain the
            track, clipped Irvine&#146;s rear left tyre,
            instantly puncturing it, damaging his front wing
            which in turn, caused his own right front to deflate
            also. By the time both cars returned to the pits, the
            <b>Ferrari</b>&#146;s rear section was on fire from
            bodywork, damaged by the flailing rubber of the
            shredded <b>Goodyear</b> falling onto the engine. <i>&quot;If
            someone runs into the back of you. there&#146;s not a
            lot you can do.&quot;</i> Said Irvine and, for once
            the evidence was plain to see, despite further
            excuses from Frentzen. <i>&quot;I was on the outside
            and I had no place to go.&quot; </i>He said.<i>
            &quot;I could not go on the grass. He (Irvine) ran
            over my right tyre. I think that was not
            necessary.&quot;</i> The video evidence proved that
            the opposite was true and the luckless German could
            only look forward to a roasting from his team, this
            time around. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Similar misfortune
            befell <b>David Coulthard</b>, also victim to
            Frentzen who took out part of his right wing,
            damaging his transmission and ending his race before
            it even began. How the pendulum of fate swings with
            such alarming regularity for the McLaren drivers. It
            was now the <i>&#145;Flying Finn&#146;</i>
            Hakinnen&#146;s turn for the spotlight, staying in
            the beam of the leading string of four and was never
            far from Schumacher&#146;s wing until the race order
            changed temporarily during the pit stops.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As Berger continued to
            pull away to a 7.7 second lead by lap 9, Fisichella
            was doing a great job under pressure, resisting the
            advances of Schumacher Senior. A further 10 seconds
            down the track Villeneuve in a most unusual position
            of 6th was unable to catch Jean Alesi, 5 seconds in
            front of him and was in danger of losing his place to
            Jarno Trulli in the <b>Mugen-Honda</b> powered<b>

            and it was pit stop time for some of the front
            runners, on laps 14 and 15. The Benettons on two
            stops were at a disadvantage to the Jordans and the
            Ferrari who were one a single stop but Berger managed
            to rejoin the race in 4th position behind Hakkinen
            whom he soon caught and passed. By lap 23 both
            Fisichella, leading a Grand Prix for the first time
            and Schumacher had stopped and Berger was once again
            leading the race and pushing as hard as he could to
            build a lead for his final stop on lap 34. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With Berger increasing
            his lead to 19 seconds over the Jordan driver, the </font><a

            of <b>Jan Magnussen</b> decided to let go as Berger
            was coming up to lap him. <i>&quot;I think I lost
            four or five seconds when someone&#146;s engine broke
            in front of me and it was very foggy! I almost
            stopped completely and I really felt that I had lost
            the race.&quot; </i>Said Berger.<i> &quot;It was a
            real surprise for me to continue in the lead.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The procession
            continued unchanged with the exception of
            Berger&#146;s increasing lead but by lap 34 when he
            pitted, he had not bought enough time to get in and
            out in front of Giancarlo who had inherited the lead
            again. This was not to last, for a small mistake made
            at the <i>Ostkurve </i>allowed Berger to slip through
            and regain his rightful place at the head of the
            field.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher maintained
            station about 20 seconds adrift of the leader with
            Hakkinen a further 5 seconds down. With just 7 laps
            to go and a certain 2nd place finish, Fisichella
            picked up a puncture and it was to his credit that,
            at a little under 200mph, he managed to keep the car
            under control and despite spinning at the pit lane
            entrance, had enough presence of mind to keep the
            engine running, enabling him to pit for fresh rubber.
            This put him out of contention and a further lap saw
            him retire from a hard fought race with a damaged
            radiator caused by the incident. <i>&quot;That second
            place was mine!&quot;</i> said a downhearted
            Fisichella <i>&quot;To have finished second would
            have realised another lifetime dream for me and I am
            trying to overcome the disappointment not only for me
            but for the team.&quot;</i> Referring to the fact
            that Schumacher picked him up on his way back to the
            pits after taking second place, he added, <i>&quot;Thanks
            to Michael for giving me a lift home-he is a
            gentleman and I have a lot of respect for him.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Damon Hill</b> in
            the Arrows finished another race, albeit in 8th
            position. After gaining the first point for the team
            at Silverstone, Hill was disappointed not to have
            finished higher. Having tasted the minor league
            success of a championship point, an experience he
            will remember with abundance from his previous season
            with Williams, he said, <i>&quot;A few weeks ago
            perhaps we would have been delighted to finish. But
            now we have got to the stage where we&#146;re
            disappointed because the car was very competitive for
            the circuit and we didn&#146;t get any points.&quot;</i>
            It must be galling for him to see his old seat with
            the Grove team being squandered to such a degree.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As a result of the
            increasing ban on tobacco advertising several cars
            were adorned with cryptic versions of their
            sponsor&#146;s logos. The question mark on the
            Williams car was symbolic also of the confusion that
            must now reign within the team. Schumacher has
            strengthened his hold on the driver&#146;s
            championship and the constructor&#146;s title looks
            tentative at the very most for the team. With
            arguably, still the best car on the grid, their
            performance, despite a fortuitous win by Villeneuve
            at Silverstone, has taken a drastic slide for the
            worse. The decision to replace Hill with Frentzen
            must now look, even to boss <b>Frank Williams</b>, as
            one of the few blunders of his career. Despite <b>Patrick
            Head</b>&#146;s assurance that the German will still
            be on their books next year, it looks increasingly
            unlikely, unless he can utilise the finest of tools
            he has been given and start producing top podium
            results for the rest of the season. Williams
            can&#146;t afford to throw it all away at this stage
            of the game.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the Austrian
            National Anthem played for the first time in two
            years, ironically at the same circuit where Berger
            had his last victory, he shed a private tear, no
            doubt thinking that his father would have been
            overjoyed by the occasion had he been there to
            witness it.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;I really felt
            I had some special power here this weekend,&quot;</i>
            said an emotional Berger at the end of his race. <i>&quot;This
            sport is a locked mind. I knew when I came back that
            all the Media sharks were waiting to get some
            negative headlines and I wanted to show them that
            it&#146;s different and I did it.&quot;</i> Berger
            certainly did it alright. The<i> &#145;old dog&#146;</i>
            has taught himself some new tricks and has raised the
            anti into the bargain. Instead of facing retirement
            in the absence of a competitive drive, there is now a
            price on his head.</font></p>
