            <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Disagreement over
            Steering column&#146;s position in Senna Trial. Senna
            made no mistakes</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(Imola 11 March 97)
            The trial over the death of <b>Ayrton Senna</b>
            resumed today, with prosecutor <b>Maruizio Passarini</b>
            attempting to establish from the first witness, that
            an improperly modified steering column and a poorly
            laid track surface was the cause the fatal accident.
            Mario Casoni, the driver of one of the first
            emergency vehicles to arrive at the Tamburello curve,
            testified that, on arrival, he noticed the steering
            shaft &#145;dangling from the cockpit&#146;. <b>Frank
            Williams</b>' defense attorney, <b>Oreste Dominioni</b>,
            noted that in a conflicting statement made in 1994,
            the witness said he saw the steering column on the
            ground. Professor <b>Syd Watkins</b>, the Official
            Formula 1 medic in charge who was in attendance at
            the scene, said that he removed it, setting it on the
            ground after finding it loose as he attempted to
            activate the steering wheel quick&#150;release in the
            cockpit. It was widely photographed at this point.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The fact that track
            conditions being a possible cause of the accident was
            not properly eliminated in the official
            investigation, was put forward by the defense
            attorneys. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&#145;Expert&#146;
            witness Stefano Stefanini, head of the accident unit
            of the Bologna Police, said a metal plate had been
            added to the rear suspension and had cracked long
            before the race started. The prosecutor <b>Passarini</b>
            said: &quot;I call him not because I want to show
            that the rear suspension caused the accident, but to
            show that the cars are highly sophisticated, and yet
            when there's a problem, it gets solved with a metal
            plate.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a move seemingly
            aimed at denouncing popular opinion that Senna&#146;s
            tyres, cooled by the enforced slow lap behind the
            pace car immediately prior to the resumption of the
            race, could have been a contributing factor in the
            accident, Passarini tried to clear these as the cause
            by showing the final lap time the Brazilian did
            before the crash. &quot;It was a very good
            time,&quot; said Stefanini, adding that only two
            drivers managed to better it -- Senna's teammate
            Damon Hill and future world champion Michael
            Schumacher -- and that at the end of the race.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Traffic police
            superintendent Marcello Gentili was asked about the
            trajectory taken by Senna's car and signs of braking
            on its way to the concrete wall at Tamburello.
            Gentili said there was a 21cm angle between the track
            and the trackside and there were intermittent signs
            of braking. The prosecution case also rests on its
            assertion that an angle between the asphalt and the
            trackside prevented Senna's car from braking
            properly.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the trial resumed,
            Italian <b>Pierluigi Martini</b> was called to
            testify as a former Formula One driver who knew the <b>Imola
            </b>circuit and its<b> Tamburello</b> curve well.
            &quot;A driver like Ayrton Senna didn't go off the
            track at that point unless there was a problem.&quot;
            Martini said. He told the court that drivers took the
            curve at 300km/h and that there was a small dip in
            the middle of the track which disturbed the cars.
            &quot;Myself, Senna and others were there two weeks
            before the race and the circuit officials were very
            efficient, and had the asphalt smoothed out, which
            was the only thing they could do.&quot; However he
            added that the bump effect was perfectly normal and
            common to every racing circuit in the world. He felt
            he could not say that the Tamburello bump had caused
            Senna to leave the track. Passarini's case is based
            on his conviction that Senna's modified steering
            column had failed under stress, causing him to veer
            off the curve. But Dominioni has denied the steering
            broke before the crash, and has pointed to the
            track's asphalt surface saying that it had not been
            fully investigated. The case continues.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Stewards fined the
            Arrows team $5000 because Hill's car could not be put
            in neutral after he stopped in the first practice
            session of the Australian Grand Prix. This also
            explains Hills lengthy stay on the track after his <b>Arrows
            Yamaha</b> coasted to a halt with throttle problems
            on the parade lap for the race itself. He was just
            trying to get the wheel back and make sure that the
            car was not in gear.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Silverstone (12th
            March 97)<b>Damon Hill</b> spent Thursday(12th) at <b>Silverstone</b>
            testing his <b>Arrows-Yamaha </b>before the team
            moved to <b>Paul Ricard</b> where the World Champion
            will continue running on Sunday and Monday. <b>Pedro
            Diniz</b> will also be in action at the French
            circuit where he is expected to drive on Tuesday.
            Hill completed 52 laps at Silverstone trying new
            engine mapping and &quot;a lot of bits and
            pieces&quot; according to team manager John Walton.
            His fastest lap was 1m 24.5s. Arrows are set to
            implement a series of modifications to the air box
            and chassis in time for the next race in <b>Brazil</b>.
            The performance of the <b>Yamaha</b> engine was
            unexpectedly good in Melbourne with <b>Pedro Diniz </b>at
            one point, fastest driver through the speed trap. The
            <b>TWR</b> modified C specification engine should
            hopefully be ready for the start of the European
            round of races. TWR has also hired designer <b>Tino
            Belli</b>, amid rumors that they will release current
            designer <b>Frank Dernie</b>. Belli drew the
            Fondmetal F01 car and although not a particularly
            auspicious addition to his CV, it did show promise
            before funding ran out. </font></p>

            team. &quot;I knew the moment I did not have the
            opportunity of going to a top team my life would be
            difficult. There will be a new champion this season -
            I know that. But I'm not one to walk away from a
            difficult situation,&quot; said Hill. &quot;We have
            got one race behind us and now we have to press on
            with our testing. There is a lot of work to be
            done.&quot; Finally in what must be the greatest show
            of misguided faith by any driver, ever, he concluded,
            &quot;As I said before, this weekend has shown the

            their disappointing season opener at Melbourne,
            Williams team drivers <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b> and
            Heinz-Harald Frentzen will be out testing from Sunday
            16-Wednesday 19 March at <b>Paul Ricard</b>. This is
            a routine scheduled test planned from the outset in
            conjunction with <b>Renault</b> and will be the
            team's only outing prior to the <b>Brazilian GP</b>
            on 30 March. According to <b>Patrick Head</b> the
            team will evaluate a power steering system which the <b>FW19&#146;</b>s
            will probably run from Brazil onwards. &quot;We could
            have introduced this system in Melbourne, but we
            wanted to give it a bit more mileage,&quot; he said.
            &quot;So in order to be on the safe side, we
            postponed it to Brazil.&quot; The biggest concern for
            Williams in Australia was the braking performance,
            and brake component testing will be part of the
            programme at Paul Ricard. Commenting on the race
            Villeneuve said: &quot;It was both frustrating and
            annoying to throw away all our good work, but I think
            we showed everybody we have a great car&quot;.</font></p>
