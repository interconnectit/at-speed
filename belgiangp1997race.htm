            leaving only the Mercurial <b>Jean Alesi </b>and star
            new boy, <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b> to make any
            attempt to catch him. With on track race excitement
            limited to a few overtaking manoeuvres and some
            mildly entertaining driver errors, choice of tyres
            was the key to the podium and it was
            Schumacher&#146;s decision to start the race in the
            spare car on a wet set-up and <i>intermediate</i>
            compounds, that gave him the advantage from the
            start. <i>&quot;I knew I could win.&quot;</i> He
            said. <i>&quot;I had gambled that it was only a
            shower and it paid off perfectly.&quot;</i> The
            Williams team, no doubt harking back to their <i>Monaco</i>
            debacle, once again got it wrong proving that they
            are less adaptable to changing conditions than most.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was awe inspiring
            to see the greatest technological sport in the world
            brought to it&#146;s knees by mother nature and
            whereas all the plans were made, all strategies set
            and the cars looking pretty for their brief posing
            time on the grid, the not totally unexpected
            happened. A blue sky and a temperature of over 100
            degrees changed within seconds, to a downpour of
            severe proportions, turning the track into an inky
            black slick and parts into a shallow swimming pool.
            The cars sent up bow waves as they gingerly left the
            pits on the out lap to their grid positions. Before
            the race started under the new safety car rules, the </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial"> of <b>Ralf Schumacher </b>had
            taken a turn for the worse aqua-planing into the
            barriers. A long and energetic<i> </i>Jog back to the
            pits enabled him to take over in the spare car in
            time for the race.<i> &quot;The rain was a lot
            stronger than I expected.&quot; </i>He said.<i>
            &quot;I came round the corner into a lot of water and
            I spun. I made it back to the pits to take the T-car,
            but unfortunately I did not manage to get out again
            before the pit lane closed. Starting from the back of
            the grid is always difficult.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the minutes ticked
            away and the bedraggled pit crew and board girls took
            to their positions on the grid, the rain eased and
            then stopped altogether giving way to a bright sun
            that caused the track, having dropped a full 18
            degrees in as many minutes, to start steaming like a
            hammer horror movie as the water began to evaporate
            in it&#146;s warmth.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Great standing pools
            of water were still evident especially at the <i>Bus
            stop </i>chicane and the safety car led the field
            round gingerly for the first three laps to allow for
            the majority of the excess water to be thrown clear
            by the treaded tyres. Within seconds of the start of

            size="2" face="Arial"> up to Jacques Villeneuve but
            not enough to make any headway and with the Canadian
            holding a tenuous 1.5 second lead over an extremely
            closely packed Alesi, Schumacher and Fisichella, it
            was clear that the Williams was out of it&#146;s
            depth in the prevailing conditions. At the end of the
            lap Schumacher was ready to make his move and this he
            did on Alesi at <i>La Source</i> forcing an inside
            line as the Frenchman was pushed wide into the run
            down to <i>Eau Rouge</i>. By <i>Malmemedy</i>, the
            Ferrari had closed on the </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial">Williams</font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial">. Villeneuve did not hold him
            up not that he was able to and the red car shot by
            into the spray never to be seen again.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By lap 6, <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella </b>not far behind and running on V-cut
            wet tyres, had also made short work of Alesi who like
            Villeneuve, realised that he was on the wrong tyres
            and proceeded to make his move on the Canadian.
            Villeneuve pitted immediately for an <i>intermediate</i>
            set of tyres whilst Alesi went in for <i>slicks</i>.
            This was regarded as a very brave move but one that
            would put him at an advantage as the track slowly
            dried. The cars straggled closely behind down to
            tenth position and by laps 9 and 10 the scramble was
            on for further tyre modification in the form of
            either intermediate wets or slicks. A fastest lap by
            Schumacher still on his first set of intermediates of
            2m.06s, was the first of a dozen by the German who
            proceeded to march away from the field and by the
            time Fisichella changed to slicks on the following
            lap he had a 35 second lead over the Jordan.</font></p>

            having a great weekend. Out-qualifying <b>Damon Hill</b>,
            he was now leading him and at one point briefly made
            it to third slot in the pit change melee. Hill had
            meanwhile called in for a set of intermediates to be
            prepared despite the rapidly drying track and the
            universal change to slick rubber by the rest of the
            teams. Consequently his performance suffered badly
            and he was forced to pit yet again 4 laps later for
            the right tyres. Had he waited another lap, his
            decision would have been vindicated for it started to
            rain out on the back part of the circuit at <i>Les
            Combes. &quot;I called to come in for intermediates
            and it was the wrong choice.&quot; </i>Admitted Hill
            candidly. <i>&quot;I was being held up in traffic and
            I thought the only way to make the time up was to be
            on the right tyre. I could see some rain coming and
            it did actually start to rain after I had gone to
            slicks. Even so I called the wrong shot and I should
            have stayed out longer before going in for slicks.
            I&#146;ve only got myself to blame.&quot;</i></font></p>

            size="2" face="Arial"> of <b>Mika Salo</b> putting in
            an uncharacteristic fastest lap of 2m.04.08s. This
            was immediately upstaged by Alesi who had now
            inherited second place from Fisichella and looked to
            be in a strong position setting two fastest laps in a
            row.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher finally
            pitted, having taken advantage of every last
            millimetre of his intermediate tyres and with a
            massive 60 second lead was in no danger of
            relinquishing his advantage. But it was Alesi again
            who set the yardstick for speed as he took 20 seconds
            out of Schumacher&#146;s lead on the drying track and
            yet another fastest lap of 1.57.34s.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The rains came, a bit
            late for Damon Hill, but as it seemed to be content
            to douse the far side of the circuit there was no mad
            dash for yet more tyres. It did however allow the <i>&#145;rainmeister&#146;</i>
            Schumacher to steam majestically on to open out a 40
            second lead over Alesi. <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b>

            in a day.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Alesi was to pit again
            for fresh rubber and fuel dropping down to fourth
            behind <b>Mika Hakinnen</b> who was doing
            exceptionally well having started from the back of
            the grid, his 5th place in qualifying being
            disallowed when his fuel sample did not match the one
            submitted to the scrutineers at the start of the
            weekend. His third place also is under appeal for the
            same reason and to add to his troubles he was brought
            before the stewards for overtaking whilst the pace
            car was on the circuit. <i>&quot;The final result was
            satisfactory,&quot;</i> said a guarded Hakinnen. <i>&quot;I
            had a technical problem, I was losing time every lap
            and I was concerned about fending off Heinz
            (Frentzen) to the end. It was a matter of just
            finishing the race. It was extremely difficult, but
            we managed to get through.&quot; </i>He came away
            smiling looking forward to a cold shower in Monaco
            where he lives, presumably only a mere hop by private
            jet.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lap 28 saw Schumacher
            pit for the second and last time and with the final
            placings more or less sewn up built up a 43 second
            lead over Fisichella by the time he had stopped for
            his second set of slicks. Another stop by Villeneuve
            put him down to 8th place behind a mechanically
            suspect Alesi and a superb out-braking manoeuvre at <i>Les
            Combes</i>, saw the Canadian into the points.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the time the flag
            fell Schumacher had slowed to a cruise but still
            maintained a 33 second advantage over Fisichella.
            Hakinnen took the third slot with Frentzen, Herbert
            and Villeneuve a devastating 6th, making up the rest
            of the points share out.</font></p>

            wrong tyre choice changed the whole result.</i> <i>Twelve
            points behind with five races to go is not a problem.
            The trouble is, that most of the next few races could
            also be in cold and wet weather and that is not going
            to be good for us.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Happiest man by far,
            was Fisichella. 4th at Imola, 3rd in Canada and now,
            after the disappointment of missing out an almost
            certain 2nd at <i>Hockenheim</i> due to a puncture,
            2nd at Spa. In his endearing broken English he
            struggled to express his joy. <i>&quot;I don&#146;t
            believe it! I&#146;m very happy! 2nd position!
            It&#146;s incredible!&quot; </i>he beamed and,
            pulling himself together, managed to get an
            explanatory sentence out before the standard effusive
            praise for his team. <i>&quot;It is another dream I
            have realised and now I am aiming for victory. The
            car was not very, very quick, but it was steady and
            reliable. Now we can look forward to Monza where I
            believe we have the chance to win.&quot;</i> One can
