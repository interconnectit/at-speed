            morning, were vociferous in their appreciation for
            the man that has taken the slings and arrows of his

            have changed the outcome of the race to the advantage
            of several mid-field runners. This was not to be
            however. Blue sky dotted with clouds in all shades of
            grey heralded the formation lap and with 22 cars
            gunning their engines to the point of overheating, a

            the first corner.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the race did get
            underway, Villeneuve made a good enough start to take

            the first turn. Holding off the attack, the German
            began to pull away immediately, in pursuit of the
            Williams.</font></p>

            car on to the course until the carnage had been
            cleared. The scrum at the rear of the grid is always
            fraught with danger as any back marker will tell you,
            but Frentzen clearing the grid cleanly, made a rather
            careless move on the</font><a

            size="2" face="Arial"><b> </b>of <b>Jos Verstappen</b>
            at <i>Copse corner, </i>cutting into the
            Dutchman&#146;s front wing and puncturing his own
            rear left tyre. <i>&quot;As I was making my way
            through the field, I was bumped from behind and
            forced off the track with a rear tyre problem.&quot; </i>He
            said with some lack of conviction later. The gravel
            trap was the furthest he got to the chequered flag
            and even the walk back to the pits was not long
            enough for him to think of a decent excuse to tell
            his boss <b>Frank Williams</b> already displeased
            with his erratic services this season. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Into the pits went the
            safety car and into the distance went Villeneuve and
            Schumacher, leaving a gaggle of fairly evenly-matched
            cars to fight it out for the rest of the points. At
            the head of the following crocodile, in third place,
            was Coulthard, already holding up team mate Hakkinen
            running closely behind but, benefiting from such a
            magnificent start, was not about to give up his place
            easily and so a disorderly queue followed the
            Scotsman round the track for the next ten laps until
            the first round of pit stops began to change the
            order of the race.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher put in an
            early fast lap of 1.25.5s on lap 8 but by lap 17 the
            two leaders had pulled out a considerable gap on
            Coulthard and although 22 seconds ahead of the
            McLaren, Villeneuve was unable to shake the Ferrari
            from his tail and the gap remained a resolute 1.6
            seconds.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both cars were on two
            stop strategies and pitted within a lap of each other
            on laps 21and 22. The German was in and out in 7.1
            seconds and having built up a 25 second lead over the
            heavily fuelled-up McLaren on single stop tactics,
            took the lead anticipating a renewed skirmish with
            Villeneuve on his next pass of the pits. The Canadian
            was having a bad time of his stop and as the German
            sailed passed the pit exit expecting to see the
            Williams &#145;popping up&#146; ahead, mechanics were
            scrambling all over the front left wheel of his car
            trying to screw on a cross threaded wheel nut. It
            took them over 33 seconds to find a replacement it
            and get the car on it&#146;s way, losing 6 places in
            the process. <i>&quot;The left hand wheel became
            loose about 10 laps before my first stop and it was
            very difficult to drive the car.&quot;</i><b> </b>Said
            Villeneuve. <i>&quot;You had to turn the wheel from
            one side to the other and it became very heavy and
            the grip wasn&#146;t good. When we pitted, the wheel
            nut stuck and it took a while to change it . When
            you&#146;re just sitting there helpless in a
            situation like that, you become frustrated and more
            aggressive too. I had to push.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher continued
            to gain on Coulthard who was having all sorts of
            problems with his brake balance, locking his front
            and then his rear tyres at almost every other corner.
            This afforded the opportunity for Hakkinen to pass
            but, having been forced to wait in line for so long
            found that he was now 22 seconds down on the Ferrari.
            The McLarens both pitted for fresh rubber and fuel
            leaving the door open for both</font><a

            size="2" face="Arial">s of <b>Jean Alesi </b>and <b>Alex
            Wurz</b>, who was having the time of his life, to
            inherit 2nd and 3rd.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The German&#146;s
            Ferrari was flying and with another fastest lap of
            1.24.47 he did indeed look invincible. But all this
            was about to come to an end with a tell-tale puff of
            smoke from the left rear wheel, yet all appeared to
            be well until, after pitting again for a brief
            inspection, the car speed died on the circuit and
            Schumacher coasted it home to the garage, his wheel
            bearings shot. <i>&quot;I am not too disappointed as
            I was comfortably in he lead when it occurred.&quot;</i>
            Said a Schumacher brightly, <i>&quot;It&#146;s the
            first technical problem we have had this year and
            it&#146;s no reason to be upset. Williams still has a
            slight advantage in qualifying trim, but we are
            competitive in the race.&quot; </i>He can console
            himself with the fact that he still maintains a four
            point advantage over Villeneuve and goes to his home
            Grand Prix, the Championship leader.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Faces were even longer
            in the <i>Scuderia</i> pits when 6 laps later, Irvine
            didn&#146;t get past the pit exit after his second
            fuel stop. In a sobering reminder of events at the
            Canadian Grand Prix last year when a similar event
            occurred although more spectacularly, a half-shaft
            failure effectively put a temporary halt to
            Ferrari&#146;s indomitable march to both titles. The
            Irishman echoed his team-mate's sentiments regarding
            Ferrari&#146;s unexpected fallibility. <i>&quot;At my
            second stop the mechanics noticed there was a problem
            with the rear right wheel. It is the first time this
            season that Ferrari has had a mechanical problem and
            until now it has been incredibly reliable. In race
            trim we are very near the Williams, but we need to
            improve our qualifying. We are still
            competitive.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This put Hakkinen
            firmly in control leaving Villeneuve, having made his
            second stop, the task of carving a way through the
            Benettons of Alesi and Wurz who were maintaining
            station albeit quite a distance behind the McLaren.

            size="2" face="Arial">s of <strong>Ralf Schumacher</strong>
            and <strong>Giancarlo Fisichella </strong>were
            proving to be a disappointment after setting the
            fastest time during testing at <em>Silverstone</em>
            and fell easy prey to both Villeneuve and Coulthard.
            A one stop strategy which could have lead Fisichella
            to the podium failed after he was forced to make an
            unscheduled stop for new tyres after damaging them in
            a spin in the gravel. <i>&quot;I am very angry with
            myself.&quot;</i> He said <i>&quot;After my pit stop,
            I came off the first bend and wasted
            everything.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For the third race in
            a row <i>lady luck</i> saw fit to bestow her favours
            anywhere else but with McLaren and as Villeneuve
            roared up to Hakkinen&#146;s tail, the excited crowd
            clamoured in anticipation of a race to the finish.
            With a badly blistered rear tyre, the Finn was making
            a race of it, anticipating the moves of the marauding
            Williams. But then the Mercedes let go and
            Villeneuve, scooping the good fortune that let fly
            from the McLaren, was given the race. Looking more
            confident than he really should have in the
            circumstances, Villeneuve didn&#146;t think there
            would have been a problem overtaking the McLaren. <i>&quot;I
            could see that Hakkinen had blistered his rear tyres
            and I was waiting for the last laps to make my move
            but then he broke something.&quot; </i>But he
            recognised his change in fortune during the race by
            unwittingly complimenting Ferrari on their
            consistency this year. <i>&quot;It&#146;s great to
            see that it happened to them too, as we have had our
            share of mechanical problems too.&quot;</i> He added,
            <i>&quot;It balances out the Championship.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jean Alesi driving
            well, and lucky to finish second and Alex Wurz
            driving brilliantly in only his third Grand Prix,
            gave Benetton the Silver and the Bronze, something
            that boss <b>Flavio Briatore</b> hasn&#146;t seen in
            a while. <i>&quot;Our selection of a one-stop
            strategy was the perfect tactic today. I felt slow
            and not in good shape driving a race with a lot of
            fuel, but it was amazing to see my position improving
            all the time.&quot;</i> Alesi said afterwards. Wurz
            at a loss for words and obviously a novice at driver
            interviews said. <i>&quot;I always thought about what
            I would say at these press conferences and now
            I&#146;ve lost everything! Without the brilliant
            tactic of going just for one stop, we would not have
            managed to secure this result. I am delighted.&quot;</i>
            His modesty, with Just the right amount of deference
            to the team, should see him set fair for a future
            with the Enstone-based outfit.</font></p>

            getting in the points. The four second gap between
            him and old adversary, <b>Shinji Nakano </b>looked
            fairly insurmountable until the Japanese
            driver&#146;s <b>Mugen-Honda</b> engine gave up the
            ghost on the penultimate lap. Hill couldn&#146;t
            believe <i>his </i>luck and started to wave to the
            crowd as if he was to be first passed the line.
            Bringing back a situation he hasn&#146;t experienced
            since last year, Hill was in a jubilant mood
            afterwards. <i>&quot;I feel like I&#146;ve won
            something!&quot;</i> he said, <i>&quot;I only got a

            went past and I was actually waving at the crowd I
            was so excited!&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">No matter that Hill
            was nowhere to be seen when the Champagne started
            spraying, the crowd had been satisfied, Hill had
            regained a great deal of dignity and from an outside
            observer&#146;s point of view at least, his
            relationship with <b>Tom Walkinshaw</b> seemed on
            slightly firmer ground. Asked if he was happy with
            the result Hill said: <i>&quot;I am pleased but I
            would have done just as well without the criticism.
            The best we could have hoped for was a point.&quot;</i>
            Walkinshaw&#146;s acknowledgement of Hill&#146;s
            achievement was tempered with a touch of the
            self-righteous when he said, <i>&quot;Sometimes you
            have to do hard things to get the best out of
            people.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It wasn&#146;t obvious
            to the thousands of Hill&#146;s loyal fans either,
            that he was doing it because he got told off in
            public. <i>&quot;I am going to give it my all for
            myself and for my supporters, who have stuck by me
            all along.&quot;</i> He told a newspaper over the
            weekend. <i>&quot;To have people cheering and waving
            their banners means a lot to me.&quot;</i> Carrying

            party pit-side, went ahead despite the disappointment
            of team boss Eddie Jordan. <i>&quot;I thought we had
            a very good chance to get a podium but unfortunately
            it didn&#146;t work out and I&#146;m disappointed
            especially here at Silverstone.&quot;</i> Before the
            music started and the beer began to flow he said, <i>&quot;We
            need to learn to maximise our opportunities and
            achieve better results in the race.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This could also have
            been the watch word at Williams this weekend and for
            a race, the outcome of which, was directly related to
            the amount of luck dished out, it seemed a fair
            result and one that has, by mid season, opened up the
            competition at the point when the championship was in
            danger of becoming a foregone conclusion.</font></p>
