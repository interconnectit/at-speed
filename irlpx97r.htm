        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Report by JAMES
            BECKETT</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Albuquerque racer JIM
            GUTHRIE fulfilled a lifelong ambition on Sunday when
            he won his maiden Indianapolis type car race, the
            Phoenix 200 at the Phoenix International Raceway -
            round four of the 1996-97 Indy Racing League.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Guthrie, a Phoenix
            track specialist in his rookie IRL season, drove a
            determined race on the one-mile oval from his
            front-row grid slot in a Dallara-Oldsmobile Aurora to
            record a victory for the Blueprint Racing Team by
            just 0.854s from pole-sitter and IRL hotshot Tony
            Stewart.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Guthrie and his
            Blueprint team had been on the pace all weekend, and
            the win came as no surprise to close watchers of IRL
            action. Following his qualifying run on Saturday,
            Guthrie had commented, &quot; Today has been like
            David and Goliath. I would like to slay the giant
            both here and at Indianapolis.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">His drive, in the
            desert heat, won him many new supporters and he heads
            to Indianapolis in May as the latest name to win an
            IRL race. His unofficial payout for winning the two
            hundred miler an impressive $170,000. A different
            driver has appeared in 'Victory Lane' at each of the
            seven races to-date. The IRL again proving that it
            provides one of the closest forms of motor sport in
            the world.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">TONY STEWART, the
            second place finisher, must be wondering just what he
            has to do to win an Indy Racing League event. Back to
            back pole-sitter, he also won the top spot at
            January's Indy 200 at Walt Disney World, has led
            every IRL race but has failed to cross the line
            first. An awesome drive by the Indianapolis based
            driver in the closing stages, following a non-routine
            stop to change tyres, saw him close upon Guthrie in
            the dying stages - his John Menard team car just a
            fraction behind when the chequered flag fell.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">His natural pace must
            make him a favourite for round five of the season,
            'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing' - the 81st running
            of the Indy 500 on May 25th.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Davey Hamilton,
            driving an AJ Foyt Enterprises/Power Team
            G-Force-Olds, was the only other competitor to
            complete the full race distance - claiming third
            position and thirty-two championship points.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brazilian Marco Greco
            in a Team Scandia Dallara, Stephan Gregoire in a
            Chastain Motorsports G-Force and Mike Groff in a
            Jonathan Byrds' G-Force completed the top six.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Groff also recorded
            the highest place finish for a Nissan Infiniti
            powered car. Roberto Guerrero, Buzz Calkins and John
            Paul Jnr. were the only other drivers to reach the
            chequered flag.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The race had nine
            caution flags for a period of ninety-six laps. Rookie
            racers, Jeret Schroeder and Sam Schmidt, were both
            transported to St.Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix for
            evaluation following accidents. Schroeder had
            evidence of a concussion and it was feared Schmidt,
            who crashed late in the race in Turn 4, was showing
            signs of a spinal fracture.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Groff's sixth place
            finish allowed him to maintain the lead of the points
            and money standings. His series lead of 125 points is
            eleven points ahead of Davey Hamilton (114), with
            Calkins, the 1996 co-champion, just one point further
            back (113).</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Marco Greco and
            Roberto Guerrero (112) complete the top five.</font></p>
