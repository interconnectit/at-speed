            face="Arial">With it's vast and fanatical following
            for Formula One and <b>Ferrari </b>especially, Italy
            had two Grands Prix as early as 1957 but a dubious
            (and oft misinterpreted ) <b>FIA </b>ruling that each
            country should only have a single Grand Prix, led to
            the small principality of <b>San Marino</b> lending
            its name to a second 'unofficial' grand prix for the <i>tifosi,</i>
            after the death of <b>Ronnie Peterson</b> at the
            previous years Grand Prix at <b>Monza.</b> It was
            used for the Italian Grand Prix again in 1980, where
            few who were there will forget the total
            disintegration of <b>Gilles Villeneuve</b>'s Ferrari
            as it came to rest in the middle of the track at the <b>Tosa</b>
            Corner. The straight leading to the corner has now
            been renamed <b>Villeneuve</b>. No matter that it is
            50 miles away from the principality, it is close
            enough to Ferrari's home stamping ground and as such
            has close links with <b>Maranello</b> and the first
            race counting for championship points, was held at
            the circuit in 1981.</font></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Built in 1950 in
                parkland 20 miles South East of Bologna, the <b><i>Autodromo
                Dino Ferrari</i></b><i> </i>was greatly updated
                with new pit complexes and hospitality suites in
                readiness for its new role in Motor Sport
                history, the authorities not knowing quite how
                notorious their circuit would become in later
                years. Following the deaths of <b>Ayrton Senna</b>
                and <b>Roland Ratzenberger</b> during the 1994
                event, further drastic alterations have taken
                place. Already the power circuit had been slowed
                with the building of a number of chicanes, but
                following these tragic events, the <b><i>Tamburello,
                Villeneuve</i></b> and <b><i>Variante Bassa</i></b>
                bends were all altered to meet the (some say)
                knee-jerk requirements of the FIA.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tamburello in
            particular has seen the lucky escapes of both <b>Nelson
            Piquet</b> and <b>Gerhard Berger</b> and of course
            the death of Senna. Once a true racing driver's
            corner this majestic fast sweeping curve has been
            clipped both front and back to ensure that no matter
            where else on the track the misfortunes of a driver
            may befall, it certainly won't be here.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Current Championship
            contender Jacques Villeneuve, said of Imola last year
            that, <i>'it used to be a nice track, but after all
            the chicanes were added, its not fun anymore.'</i>
            This seems to sum up the opinions of several drivers,
            but despite this, it is a power circuit and the cars
            with the strongest engines will survive. It will also
            test brakes to their maximum and, being (unusual for
            a European Circuit), anticlockwise, it will be tough
            on the drivers' stamina.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Gary Anderson</b>
            Technical Director of <b>Jordan Peugeot</b> reckons
            that the European circuits are real 'race tracks'
            rather than temporary ones that are used only a few
            times a year,<i> &quot;In Europe the track itself
            does not dictate the lap time as has been the case in
            the first three Grands Prix where, because of the
            dirt, a small mistake can result in a big loss in
            time.&quot; </i>He explains,<i> &quot;At Imola the
            drivers can really push because the surface is
            cleaner and the traction consequently much higher.
            For Imola you need a responsive car to cope with the
            fast chicanes, the braking and the changes of
            direction.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">World Champion <b>Damon
            Hill</b> had a great tactical win here last year,
            pulling an extra 6 laps worth of fuel at the start,
            to enable an 'out of sync' pit stop that would put
            him ahead of <b>Michael Schumacher</b>. With the
            unwitting help of 'hot off the line' <b>David
            Coulthard</b> who held Schumacher in check, Hill was
            able to stay in touch with the Ferrari until he lost
            the fuel weight and the German had to pit. No such
            luck for our glum chum this year. It is interesting
            to note that last year, Hill had won all of the
            Grands Prix contested this year so far, including
            Imola and it must be disheartening for the man to see
            his name gradually being eradicated from the
            statistics. With the flagging <b>Yamaha</b>, even a
            finish looks unlikely but no one could drag a better
            performance from the <i>'old Danka'</i> like Hill who
            in turn, will behave like a true champion and give
            the <b>TWR</b> team his full support as he sees his
            dreams, however modest for this season, crumble even
            further.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The race this year
            will mark the 200th grand prix appearance of Austrian
            veteran <b>Gerhard Berger</b>, who would love to
            celebrate with a grand prix victory at the circuit on
            which he has not won previously. There is no reason
            why he should not, as despite qualifying badly put in
            a feisty performance in Buenos Aires last week.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Stewart Ford</b>
            driver <b>Rubens Barichello</b> was a happy man after
            Argentina despite not finishing what would have been
            a fine race for him. <i>&quot;After the race I told
            my crew to leave my car alone-it was the best I had
            ever driven! Even though we didn't finish, I know how
            much potential the car has and our performance in
            practice and qualifying proved it.&quot; </i>He went
            on in a more sober mood, reflecting on the events
            in1994, <i>&quot;In one dark weekend we lost Roland,
            and in Ayrton I lost not only a personal friend, but
            a fellow Brazilian who was a giant in our sport. On
            top of that I had a very big accident myself.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Choice of tyres will
            also be critical here, as the 'grippiness' of the
            soft <b>Bridgestones</b>, especially exiting the
            chicanes, will be extremely good. A decision for the <b>Goodyear</b>
            runners in choosing hard tyres for added durability,
            could have serious consequences on a track with so
            many tight corners.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With little or no
            passing areas, this could end up being a race of
            strategies where most of the passing is done in the
            pit lane during refuelling and retreading. A heavier
            car with tyres that last could have an advantage over
            a nimble but delicately shod machine that may have to
            make extra pitstops. Goodyear softs blistered badly
            in the heat in Argentina, but the heat should not be
            so much of a problem in the European Spring weather
            and heaven help the top teams should it rain. With
            the Bridgestone's reputation already legendary in the
            Pit lane and the <b>Prost Honda</b> of <b>Olivier
            Panis</b> making inroads to the 'big 5' a shake up
            for the podium could be in order.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The inevitability
            however will be that the <b>Williams Renault</b> will
            dominate. Villeneuve's certainly, <b>Heinz Harald
            Frentzen</b>'s debatably. Putting a brave face on it
            after Argentina and, bitterly disappointed, he called
            all the good spirits to his aid and declared, <i>&quot;I
            hope I'm in the valley of my luck graph and that
            Imola will be the start of my season. &quot;</i> <b>Mika
            Hakkinen </b>consistent so far in all his races this
            year, should also finish in the points and, is only
            one point down on team mate Coulthard despite the
            Scot having taken the glory in the opening round at <b>Melbourne</b>.
            Be prepared to give <b>Jarno Trulli</b> a big hand
            too. A future champion in the making there, and if
            the scrapping Jordan duo of <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>
            and <b>Giancarlo Fisichella </b>can keep out of each
            other's wheels, then we should see many flashes of
