            this horse is bound to stumble. This is by no means a
            criticism, it might be a salute to the smaller owners
            who know that to take the ultimate prize is but a
            passing fantasy as brief as the time it takes for the

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The horse, of course,
            is a car, the car is a Lola and it&#146;s got form.
            Arguably the world&#146;s most successful racing car
            constructor, a five times <b>CART</b> World Series
            Championship winner, three times <b>Indy 500</b>
            winner and the taker of 6 world titles in the
            Japanese <b>F3000 </b>series, this team has a
            pedigree as long as a giraffe&#146;s neck. As a
            constructor it supplies chassis used in both the
            European F3000 and <b>Indy Lights</b> series.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Founder and Chairman <b>Eric
            Broadley</b>, is a brave man, a veteran of motor
            sport and responsible for the continued presence of
            Lola cars in all guises since 1958 and still with a
            vision and a passion for racing. He said: &quot;Lola
            has an involvement in Formula 1 which stretches back
            a long way, but our entries in the short term have
            always been with partners. We decided that we had to
            be back in F1. Grand Prix racing is big business and
            the manner in which Lola is developing for the
            future, outside the pure motorsport field, makes
            Formula 1 the ideal shop window for us. I am not
            predicting big results this year, we have a lot to
            learn and there are a lot of other good teams out
            there, but we will win in the future.&quot;</font></p>

            discovers the press of the world's media</strong></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rather than giving the
            design of the car to a single mind, Broadley has
            taken the singularly novel approach of building a
            team of skilled individuals, each using their
            specialist knowledge to contribute to the production
            of a final car design, using the latest in machining
            and composite technologies. &quot;We take our
            engineers, in areas such as composites, car dynamics
            and aerodynamics and co-ordinate their work in the
            final product.&quot; He explained. Indeed Broadley
            has seen the bright boys come and go. Patrick Head of
            Williams and John Barnard of (soon to be ex) Ferrari
            have both worked under him in the early days of their
            careers. Now, over 35 specialist staff have been
            active in creating the car from its digital
            conception to complete chassis build in under three
            months.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This was no mean feat
            and the result of all this frenzied activity was
            revealed last Thursday (20th). Lola gave birth to the
            <b>MasterCard T97/30</b> on the same bed as the
            Jordan team, in the Ballroom of the London Hilton.
            There was less flash and more informality about it.
            The suave <b>Steve Rider</b> was not present to host
            the event but helicopter aerobatic expert and DJ <b>Mike
            Smith,</b> was. The sheet was whisked away by two of
            the prettiest girls yet seen in &#145;Sparco&#146;,
            to reveal an extremely presentable and well turned
            out machine resplendent in the blue and red of its
            major sponsor MasterCard and the lurid yellow of Oil
            sponsor Pennzoil.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite Lola&#146;s
            prolonged absence from F1 and due to constant
            updating of their computer model to keep abreast of <b>FIA</b>
            rule changes, the car looks comfortingly similar to
            all the others. Aerodynamically styled by <b>Joanna
            Moss</b> with the help of Cranfield University&#146;s
            40% wind tunnel, it bears no traits of a feminine
            hand. The &#145;coke&#146; bottle rear end and barge
            boards seem fairly conventional as does the raised
            nose that all the cars are sporting this year. <b>Chris</b>
            <b>Murphy</b>, senior engineer said, &quot;The high
            nose has less technical impact than is imagined but
            it gives more scope for development, to change the
            position of the front wing in height more
            easily.&quot; With a reconfigurable rear wing and
            confirmation that it will undertake its own engine
            development and build programme in order to produce
            an in-house V10 unit, the car has potential for
            future evolution. &quot;We are not going to win in
            Formula One without a super engine and if we couldn't
            get it, then we would have to make one,&quot;
            Broadley said. Whether the car in this early guise
            will make the <b>107% minimum</b> (whereby all cars
            have to be within 107% of the fastest time to qualify
            for a race start), remains to be seen. But Broadley
            made it clear when he said, &quot;We should get
            within 107% and if we don't, then we should not be in
            the sport.&quot; </font></p>

            size="2" face="Arial">New driver, Italian <b>Vincenzo
            Sospiri</b> agreed confidently, &quot;I hope we can
            just get points by the end of the year and I am sure
            we will have no problems qualifying throughout the
            season.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It takes big bucks to
            dump the scrappy <b>Ford Zetec V8</b> engine and go
            build your own, yet with the full weight of Major
            sponsor MasterCard&#146;s financial involvement
            coming on-stream mid season, the timing could be
            right.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Lola T97/30 will
            be tested for the first time at <b>Santa Pod Raceway</b>
            in England on Saturday, before a major two-day test
            at <b>Silverstone</b> early next week.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The cars will then be
            shipped out next Thursday(27th), for the <b>Australian
            Grand Prix</b> in Melbourne on March 9.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yet for all the
            innovation, the design skills and the backing,
            hindrance to all aspirations of podium finishes lurks
            in the shadows of the pit lane to blow you away. It
            is called a Williams. This is now regrettably, a
            Formula one fact and is pertinent to 75% of this
            years grid. Improvements have been made to all teams,
            and with few exceptions, testing has gone better than
            expected. Even the giants like <b>McLaren</b> and <b>Ferrari</b>
            more often than not, will have to bend in the
            slipstream of the predictably quick FW19. Maybe
            however, this year, with teams as dedicated as Lola
            exuding the new confidence of &#145;small town&#146;
            Formula 1, and relatively inexperienced drivers such
            as <b>Sospiri</b> and Brazilian, <b>Ricardo Rosset</b>
            hungry for recognition, there will be some fire in
            the midfield. The top steps of the podium may still
            be out of reach, but the scrapping for the lesser
            points could well provide all the spectacle and
            excitement this year.</font></p>
