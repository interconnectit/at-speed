            victory pie.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For the Jordan team,
            located a mere 50 yards from the circuit gates, it
            should be a straight forward event. <i>&quot;The
            British Grand Prix is very different to the other
            races,&quot;</i> explained Boss <b>Eddie Jordan</b>. <i>&quot;not
            simply because it is our home, but because of the
            historical connections. Eddie Jordan racing was the
            first team to set up at Silverstone in 1980 and the
            Grand Prix acts as a reminder of how far we have come
            since then. It is also the closest race to Ireland so
            we have a huge number of fans who come to see
            us.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Silverstone is not
            favoured by drivers as their circuit of choice. Windy
            and bleak, at times, desolate and lacking in the
            picturesque qualities that make circuits like<b> Spa </b>and
            <b>Imola</b> so &#145;user friendly&#146;, it is
            first and foremost a &#145;high speed&#146; track and
            despite subsequent redesigning of some corners, it
            still remains one of the fastest.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both<b> Crystal Palace
            </b>and<b> Brooklands </b>- which held the first ever
            Grand Prix in 1926 - were already falling into
            disrepair and a new venue was badly needed to
            accommodate the ever increasing demands of faster
            cars. Built on an old airfield leased from the Air
            Ministry in 1948, the first track laid out over the
            straight runways and perimeter roads was a rather
            makeshift affair with the pits in nearby farm
            buildings and the 3.7 mile circuit marked out with
            hay bales. By 1949, with a chicane added at <i>Club
            Corner,</i> the basic layout was formed and on May
            13th of the following year, the first officially
            designated Formula 1 Grand Prix of Europe took place
            in front of no lesser nobility then King George IV
            himself. The race was won by the <b>Alfa Romeo</b> of
            <b>Nino Farina</b> who would dominate the season to
            become World Champion.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The pits were
            eventually relocated to the runway between <i>Copse
            Corner </i>and <i>Woodcote</i> and the track
            resurfaced. By 1961 the <b>British Racing Drivers
            Club </b>purchased the lease outright, the track
            alternating with <b>Aintree</b> from1955 til 1973
            when the much friendlier circuit at <b>Brands Hatch</b>
            hosted the even years up until 1986. A chicane was
            added at <i>Woodcote</i> in 1975 after a major start
            finish pile up, triggered by <b>Jody Scheckter</b> at
            <i>Woodcote</i>, eliminated seven teams at a stroke.
            The chicane itself was replaced in 1988 by a short
            dog leg which was unpopular with the drivers as it
            completely changed the rhythm of the circuit. Further
            modifications carried out last year, re-aligned <i>Copse</i>
            and opened up both <i>Priory</i> and <i>Brooklands</i>
            aiding a faster entry through <i>Luffield</i> and <i>Woodcote
            </i>corner which by now had become a sweeping right
            hander. With tunnels and bridges added and a new
            Press centre, Silverstone has become the premier
            motor racing circuit in Britain and has exclusive
            rights to the British Grand Prix well into the
            Millennium, leaving the spectator friendly circuits
            of Brands and <b>Donnington </b>to lesser automotive
            activities.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Memorable for several
            firsts, Silverstone saw both Ferrari and Williams
            take their maiden Grand&#146;s Prix in 1951 and 1979
            respectively. It also marked the first appearance of
            a Turbo charged engine in the <b>Renault</b> of <b>Jean-Pierre
            Jabouille</b> and the race debuts of <b>Gilles
            Villeneuve</b> in a <b>McLaren</b> and <b>Patrick
            Tambay </b>in an<b> Ensign Ford. </b>It was also the
            scene of <b>Johnny Herbert</b>&#146;s first GP win,
            in a Benneton in 1995.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Extensive testing has
            been carried out at the circuit by most teams and
            already <b>Damon Hill</b>&#146;s pole position last
            year of 1.26.87 has been bettered by almost 5 and a
            half seconds by fastest Jordan driver <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b> with a 1.21.44s. Jordan&#146;s
            Technical director <b>Gary Anderson</b> says of the
            new configurations, <i>&quot;The circuit is far
            better than last year. It is faster and more of a
            driver&#146;s circuit, with excellent quick sections.
            The surface is a little mixed, as the resurfaced
            areas have lots of grip and other areas do not.
            Aerodynamically we don&#146;t have a problem on areas
            which lack grip.&quot;</i> Regarding tyres he
            continued, <i>&quot;The problems Giancarlo
            experienced in France when he could not get his tyres
            up to temperature should not occur here because the
            first section is all fast corners. In addition the
            slow section before the start of the lap gives the
            drivers the confidence to push.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The big question is,
            has Williams put anything into it&#146;s bag of
            tricks that will be the equal of the Ferrari? Boss <b>Frank
            Williams</b> must surely bring an early autumn to <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b>&#146;s silly season. With Ferrari
            holding both <i>Constructors</i> and <i>Driver&#146;s
            Championship</i> cards, and looking extremely strong
            for a fifth win this year, it has to be down to the
            Didcot outfit to fly the British flag. There seems
            little likelihood of current World Champion Damon
            Hill doing it in his beleaguered </font><a

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jordan will be
            confident for obvious reasons but with the recently
            announced <b>Mugen Honda</b> tie up for the next two
            seasons, they will be anxious to leave Peugeot with
            style. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>David Coulthard</b>,
            so unjustly out of the points both in France and
            Montreal for McLaren, will do his utmost to reverse
            his unlucky streak as will both Benetton drivers.
            Whether <b>Alex Wurz</b>, who is proving to be an
            exceptionally talented addition to boss <b>Flavio
            Briatore</b>&#146;s stable, gets to stand in yet
            again for the ailing <b>Gerhard Berger</b>, remains
            to be seen, but having upstaged team mate <b>Jean
            Alesi</b> in both his outings, he looks a sure fire
            bet for the Frenchman&#146;s seat next season.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The young pretenders
            are now coming on stream and podium places can not be
            ruled out for the excellent <b>Jarno Trulli</b>
            having the time of his life &#145;driving&#146; in,
            for the injured <b>Olivier Panis</b> in the <b>Prost
            Mugen Honda</b> and Ralf Schumacher hungry now for
            the number one slot after having tasted the
            Champagne. </font></p>

            indeed the team to watch for next year. </font><a

            experts, urgently seeking to identify and eradicate
            the bug which caused onboard computers on both cars
            to shut down all the control systems during the
            French Grand Prix.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Class of the field
            will not necessarily be the Williams Renault despite
            a new evolution V10 to be used for qualifying. It may
            get them to the front of the grid, but if the changes
            promised by Ferrari - which include a narrower rear
            wing, revised suspension geometry and the Step 2 V10
            - move the Prancing Horse in the direction that it
            has been going all season, then the boys in blue will
            indeed be seeing red. It is also useful that the
            Ferrari is the only car of that hue, as all the
            spectators will see of it, especially along the back <i>Hanger
            straight</i> will be a scarlet blur, but enough to
            know that if all goes well, the <b><i>Scuderia</i></b>
            will have another race in the bag by close of play
            and Williams will be wiping even more pasta from
            their collective faces. Villeneuve will have the
            craving for victory too, but maybe not the head. A
            fast race is expected and provided the rain and wind
            stays away, a <i>Battle Royal</i> should be expected.</font></p>
