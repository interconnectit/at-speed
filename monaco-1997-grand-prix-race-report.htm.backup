            sang, &quot;You don&#146;t need a weatherman to know
            which way the wind blows&quot;. It&#146;s a pity that
            <b>Frank Williams</b> didn&#146;t pay heed to that
            portentous phrase, for had he done so, his two
            drivers may have been languishing in the winners
            circle and enjoying the accolades that, even as the
            team were packing up their equipment, their rivals <b>Ferrari</b>,
            were now enjoying.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The unpredictability
            of the weather in Monte Carlo once again played
            it&#146;s part in the outcome of the <b><i>Monaco
            Grand Prix</i></b> and in what may turn out to be the
            single most ill-judged decision of the season,
            Williams threw away a race that they had every chance
            of winning and for the time being at least, handed
            the lead for both Constructors and Drivers
            Championship to the riders of the Prancing Horse.
            With 19 of the 22 cars on the grid sporting full or
            intermediate wet weather tyres and the rain pelting
            down, it was unbelievable to see the two <b>Williams
            FW19</b>&#146;s shod with dry slicks. <b>David
            Coulthard</b>&#146;s <b>McLaren Mercedes</b> too had
            them, which led one to wonder what mis-informed
            meteorological secret the two teams were privy too,
            for, to send your driver out in such conditions was
            either stupendously foolhardy or fabulously hopeful.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Heinz Harald
            Frentzen</b>&#146;s hard work obtaining pole the day
            before, came to nothing as the <b>Ferrari</b> of <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b> on intermediate wet tyres and in the
            spare car, set up wisely for a &#145;damp&#146; race,
            rocketed away from the line leaving his fellow
            countryman desperately trying to keep the car under
            control, his slicks providing zero adhesion on the
            soaking track. <b>Jacques Villeneuve </b>immediately
            behind was in the same boat and could do nothing but
            watch as the <b>Jordan</b> of <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b>
            swanned by, leaving him in fourth with a gaggle of
            sure footed machinery behind and all of them about to
            pounce.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the start of lap 3
            Schumacher had pulled out a lead of over 12 seconds
            and the slithering Williams of Frentzen had been
            passed by <b>Ralf Schumacher</b> <b>Johnny Herbert</b>,
            and <b>Bridgestone </b>Runners, <b>Rubens Barichello</b>
            and <b>Olivier Panis, </b>while Villeneuve had
            dropped to a miserable 8th. It took both Williams
            drivers the best part of 5 laps to realise that if
            they wanted any chance of a race finish they would
            have to pit for treaded tyres by which time really,
            the damage had been done. Villeneuve fell off the
            track 12 laps later after being ignominiously lapped
            by Schumacher, hitting the Armco and damaging the
            rear suspension. This was his third retirement in
            five races and to lose almost two minute to the
            Ferrari in just a dozen laps, must have been a
            humbling experience.<i> &quot;We had data telling us
            it wasn&#146;t going to be wet after half an hour but
            it turned out it actually rained </i>more!<i>&quot; </i>he
            said seemingly non-plussed,<i>&quot; So our dry set
            up with slicks was useless. Even with intermediate
            tyres (wets) the car was not set up for these
            conditions and it was very difficult to drive.
            Eventually, I hit the guard rail and the car was too
            damaged to continue.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Maybe on reflection,
            Jacques will recall a similar situation at <b><i>Barcelona
            </i></b>last year when the &#145;SS Schumacher&#146;
            steamed through the field leaving main protagonist
            Hill, spinning out of contention in front of the
            pits, the victim of an imperfect meteorological
            judgement. Despite a dark sky, pregnant with rain and
            following a wet warm up session, a gamble was taken
            on a dry race. One would have thought that Williams
            would have taken heed of past experiences.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As early as lap 2,
            carnage at the <i>Nouvelle chicane </i>put paid to
            both McLaren drivers. Coulthard, suffering bad
            oversteer, crashed into the rails after exiting the
            tunnel and ended up facing the way he had come,
            making an unwelcome surprise for team mate <b>Mika
            Hakkinen</b> who followed a second or so later.
            Trying to avoid his team mate he found himself wedged
            between <b>Jean Alesi</b>&#146;s Benetton and the
            barriers, and removed himself from the race with only
            three wheels on his wagon. As the third string of
            cars threaded their way through, The Ferrari of <b>Eddie
            Irvine </b>came accross the freshly thumped Benetton
            at the chicane&#146;s exit. Braking heavily to avoid
            a collision, he was railroaded from behind by the
            close following <b>Arrows</b> of <b>Damon Hill</b>. <i>&quot;I
            was right behind Irvine and there were a lot of cars
            that fell off, coming out of the tunnel,&quot; </i>he
            said later,<i> &quot;Coulthard spun and there was a
            Benetton that had spun also and as we went round the
            chicane we made our way through all these crashed
            cars. A Benetton came over the curb and stopped right
            in the middle of the track. So Irvine had to stop and
            I was right behind him and I just went up the back of
            him.&quot;</i> Irvine was quite unconcerned by it
            all. Having gained the middle ground during the early
            part of the race after such a disastrous qualifying
            position, the ongoing attrition was doing him nothing
            but good. <i>&quot;The first few laps were
            crazy,&quot; </i>He grinned, <i>&quot;I was hitting
            people, they were hitting me up the back and on the
            side. God knows how many times I was hit, The Ferrari
            must be a very strong car.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By lap 4 the
            Schumacher&#146;s Ferrari had a 16 second lead over
            the extraordinary Giancarlo Fisichella, continuing to
            put his stamp on the Jordan team and dominating for
            the third race in a row, team mate Ralf Schumacher.
            Spinning at <i>Loew&#146;s</i> hairpin, the young
            German was caught and passed by a storming <b>Rubens
            Barichello</b> having the drive of his life in the <b>Stewart
            Ford</b>, who now, had his teeth bared for
            Fisichella&#146;s Jordan. The impetuous Schumacher
            junior was to lose a wheel on lap 11 at <i>Saint
            Devote</i>, a corner that trapped several drivers,
            including on lap 36, Michael Schumacher who&#146;s
            diligent and quick thinking action saved him from
            disaster.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile 4th placed
            man and winner of Last years race, <b>Olivier Panis</b>
            was rapidly approaching the remaining Jordan of
            Fisichella, who was driving with all the smoothness
            and confidence of a champion. Panis by contrast was
            evidently anxious to pass and at stages he was lucky
            to keep the car under control losing it on several
            occasions in his desperation to pass.
            Fisichella&#146;s calmness under such pressure was
            indeed commendable, but eventually Panis harried his
            way through to take third place on lap 31. <i>&quot;This
            was a difficult race,&quot; </i>said Fisichella
            afterwards, <i>&quot;We started on intermediate tyres
            hoping the circuit would dry, but it began to rain
            very hard</i> <i>and our tyres were not providing
            good grip, especially under braking. This made the
            car very difficult to drive and I was never able to
            apply full power otherwise I would have slid off the
            course. I feel it was a miracle to have finished the
            race! It was a complete 'Casino' which is appropriate
            for Monaco.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fisichella also
            succumbed to Irvine at the exit from the tunnel a lap
            later. The Irishman having already made his pit stop,
            then stole the march on Panis&#146; <b>Prost</b> to
            cement third spot for the remainder of the race.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Mika Salo</b> in
            the <b>Tyrrell Ford</b>, running an incredible non
            stop race, overtook the Jordan during their fuel
            stop, to take fifth slot, the Italian regaining the
            track in 7th position behind <b>Jan Magnussen</b>. <i>&quot;We
            reduced the fuel mix and the revs and I started
            coasting through the comers to stay off the power and
            changing gear earlier.&quot; </i>Said Salo, <i>&quot;It
            was great thinking, but I wasn't sure I would make
            it. My tyres were completely shot.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
            src="msa97ab.jpg" width="250" height="321"></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By lap 40 the race was
            all but over. <b>Johnny Herbert</b> had spun into a
            barrier at <i>Saint Devote</i> on lap 8. Alesi spun
            and stalled his engine at <i>Portiers</i> on lap 16, <b>Larini</b>
            retired after hitting a barrier on lap 24 as did <b>Nakarno</b>
            on lap 36 and, to top it all Frentzen&#146;s
            nightmare came to an end with a front end nudge at <i>Louis
            Chiron</i> by the swimming pool complex on lap 39.
            Williams, <i>&#145;zero points.&#146;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher took the
            flag with ten cars out of twenty two remaining, a
            massive 53 seconds ahead of a delighted Barichello. <i>&quot;It&#146;s
            just great to be here, on the podium at Monaco.&quot;</i>
            beamed the Brazilian, <i>&quot;It&#146;s not so long
            ago that I used to get up at eight in Brazil, to
            watch Ayrton Senna at Monaco. For me to be on the
            podium here is something else.&quot;</i> It was also
            something else for team owner and three times
            Champion, Jackie Stewart who, emotional and hardly
            able to speak, managed to say, <i>&quot;I have never
            been happier in my whole career. Not from a victory
            not from a championship, NEVER. When Rubens crossed
            the line Paul (Stewart) and I burst out crying.&quot;
            </i>The tears didn&#146;t mask a gleam in his eyes
            when he added, <i>&quot;I have never been second
            before and but for a certain Mr. Schumacher, Ferrari
            would have been second today.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><i><img
            src="rb97mowi.jpg" width="250" height="352"></i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After giving Ferrari
            team boss Jean Todt a joyous chair lift the two
            Ferrari drivers abandoned Barichello on the podium to
            give their pit crew a liberal dowsing of Moet.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It seems extraordinary
            that two of the most experienced teams in Formula 1
            were caught out on such a simple call. There was no
            sympathy for Frank Williams who remarked at the end
            of the day, <i>&quot;If it had worked out, it would
            have made us heroes.&quot;</i> Well, so what? If this
            writer had won the lottery he would be rich. A high
            tech sport such as this should not be subject to such
            long odds and the Williams strategists must have
            noted that, had it stopped raining, it would have
            still taken 15 minutes for a dry line to emerge to
            warrant the use of slicks. The time gained by the
            slick shod drivers, whilst the rest of the grid dived
            in for dry tyres would certainly not have been
            anywhere near enough to warrant the decision to run a
            dry set-up at the outset.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Again Jordan Peugeot
            put in a satisfying show despite <b>Eddie Jordan</b>&#146;s
            disappointment. <i>&quot;It is frustrating to come
            away with only one point but Giancarlo did a
            fantastic job under very difficult race
            conditions.&quot;</i> He said.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Apart from Ferrari the
            race belonged to the second string teams all of which
            had a fair bite of the apple and it is to Jackie
            Stewart&#146;s credit that his faith in Barichello
            has reaped its just reward.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There will be a new
            pecking order in 1997. Whilst Williams may just be
            hanging on to the top spot by a thread from Big Red,
            The Jordans and Stewarts and Prosts are already
            reserving their places and, if Benetton and McLaren
            don&#146;t watch out, there will be no tickets left.</font></p>
