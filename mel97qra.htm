            1997) </b>They can&#146;t put it off any longer, the
            day of reckoning is at hand. With yesterday&#146;s
            free practice, there was still time to make excuses,
            still time to pretend that they weren&#146;t trying
            to set a fast time and there was still just the
            slimmest possibility of avoiding the dreaded
            exclusion zone of the &#145;club-no-one
            wants-to-be-in&#146;, the &#145;hundred and seven
            percenter&#146;s&#146;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With <b>Bridgestone</b>
            shipping in excess of 2000 tyres for its five
            contracted teams and <b>Goodyear</b> 1800 for their
            seven, the choice of rubber is quite bewildering.
            Goodyear tyres are now given names such as
            &#145;Optional&#146; and &#145;Prime&#146; compounds
            rather than code numbers as before, to quote their
            press release, &quot;In view of the new competitive
            tyre-supply environment.&quot; If the race is wet,
            the drivers have three specifications from which to
            choose. Bridgestone shod teams will be expected to do
            well as winter testing has produced some spectacular
            results. <b>Arrows</b> driver and current <b>World
            Champion Damon Hill</b> who spent the best part of
            six months developing the tyres, unwittingly lit the
            fires of curiosity by turning in some pretty quick
            times. Now, with four other teams at the lower end of
            the grid similarly shod and gaining all the benefit
            of Arrows research without have to spend a copper,
            the competition will inevitably be split three ways
            between drivers teams and tyres.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, with tyre
            controversy providing suitable camouflage for the
            real speed of the collective grid and the
            psychological games teams are wont to play on each
            other&#146; Friday practice closed in a cloak and
            dagger atmosphere. The fastest of the Bridgestone
            cars was <b>Olivier Panis</b> in the renamed <b>Prost</b>
            holding 12th place and with the exception of the two <b>Tyrells</b>,
            all behind had Japanese rubber. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Adversity could turn
            out to be Hill&#146;s best friend this year. Fresh
            rumours of bursts of anger and contract ripping
            followed the story of the &#145;Arrows that lost its
            wing&#146;. Not content with giving the Champ one of
            the most miserable testing periods in Formula One
            history, with gearbox problems, water leaks expiring
            engines and inclement weather, adversity stripped the
            last vestiges of self-respect from his disillusioned
            frame when his front wing dropped off in what could
            have been an extremely dangerous accident. The rumour
            continued apace, with <b>Martin Brundle</b> recently
            appointed director at Arrows, having to take over and
            bed the new car in as Hill took an early flight to
            surf away his anger on the beaches of Southern Oz. No
            stranger is Hill to these feelings however, ask <b>Frank
            Williams</b> about it. Hill now pushing his car to
            13th on the grid was probably fueled by his anger and
            against all informed media pundits&#146;
            expectations, has set an initial time that gives
            credit to his driving abilities.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With <b>Mika Hakkinen</b>
            the slowest of the two <b>Mclaren</b> drivers only 4
            tenths of a second in front and the <b>Ferrari</b> of
            <b>Eddie Irvine</b> less than half a second in front
            of the Finn, the chances of a point for Hill, do not
            look as remote as they did less than a week ago. <b>Schumacher</b>
            the wily sandbagger, might just have been caught out,
            by setting the fastest time of the day. Maybe
            thinking that the Williams pair of <b>Heinz-Harald
            Frentzen</b> and <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b> would show
            their stride a little more forcefully than they did,
            he may have been a touch heavy handed with the
            throttle. How much the German has left under his foot
            and whether the Williams FW19&#146;s were running
            under a leash, will shortly be revealed.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Traditionally teams
            concern themselves with set up, downforce adjustment
            , choice of tyres and pit stop configurations at free
            practice and the grid is fairly meaningless, but as
            it&#146;s the first day of term, the guys that moved
            up a grade are being closely scrutinised by the new
            boys and are loth to give any of their secrets away.
            Who knows therefore, if the relatively poor showing
            of the <b>Stewart Ford</b> is just &#145;setting
            up&#146; or, was Hill running &#145;D&#146; compound
            tyres and just enough fuel for two laps? Did Williams
            run on full tanks today and, have Ferrari found a few
            more miles per hour with their re modified
            turning-vanes? Will the <b>Lola&#146;s</b> qualify
            not only for this race but any of the races until
            they get their new engine? Could the sight of <b>Sospiri</b>
            sitting on the pit wall during the race be as regular
            an occurrence as the billowing smoke from the <b>Yamaha
            </b>of Hill&#146;s or Diniz&#146; Arrows?</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here, conjecture
            becomes fantasy and the green light is just about to
            go on at the exit to the pit lane. Fridays times were
            just a taster and imminently, the truth will out. No
            more secrets now. The teams are collectively naked,
            the cloaks are off , the daggers are out and an

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>(Saturday March 8th
            1997)</b> The questions that have been asked all
            winter have been answered in the hour of qualifying
            at The <b>Albert Park Circuit</b> today. Everybody of
            course got most of them right. <b>Williams</b>
            fastest by a country mile? Of course they were. <b>McLarens</b>
            and <b>Ferraris</b> in the scrum? Of course they
            were, <b>Arrows</b> way out of contention? Of course
            they were. <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b> playing
            second fiddle to King Jacques? Of course he is and <b>Jean
            Alesi</b> fails to deliver, right again. The big
            question that most of us got wrong however was the
            Tyre question. <b>Bridgestone </b>remained firmly at
            the back of the grid with only <b>Olivier Panis </b>again
            making a brief showing of speed to end up in 9th
            place.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the front runners
            mostly on soft compounds with the exception of <b>Schumacher</b>
            and the Bridgestone brigade running hard, it seemed a
            pretty even match and judging from the extremely poor
            performances of the second half of the grid, probably
            made no significant contribution to overall lap
            times.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With a rising track
            temperature in excess of 30C the cars trickled out
            one by one, Villeneuve setting the early pace, mildly
            harried by the two McLarens looking splendid in their
            new livery. <b>Damon Hill </b>managed an early lap
            before the Arrows gremlins struck again forcing him
            to sit in the spare car looking out at the pit wall
            whilst mechanics feverishly worked on a water leak.
            This was in addition to the problems he had in the
            warm up session in the morning when he only managed a
            lap before being towed in. The red blur that passed
            his line of vision was Schumacher struggling with an
            unwieldy Ferrari, fighting it every inch of the way,
            yet almost throwing it across the line to make the
            upper side of the second row. The Williams pit saw
            Villeneuve sitting quietly in his car and Heinz
            Harald Frentzen totally demoralised by
            Villeneuve&#146;s blistering opening salvo, over
            driving the car in desperate retaliation and aborting
            his run, locking his brakes when he came dangerously
            close to <b>Rosset</b>&#146;s struggling Lola.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Benetton of <b>Gerhard
            Berger</b> failed to make any impression on the
            promising times of yesterday, showing a severe drop
            in performance. Despite new parts added to the front
            wing and extra downforce applied to the rear wings on
            both cars, he failed to rise above tenth slot by the
            end of the session.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Diniz eventually made
            it out onto the track with 25 minutes left having
            also sat in the spare Arrows for a while and, with a
            singularly unspectacular performance failed to
            qualify for the race, as indeed it looked as though
            Hill might not either as, on his first proper run and
            on cold tyres, twitched around the circuit over six
            second down on the leader. A second and final run
            with only two laps remaining of his twelve, put him
            just 4 tenths inside the 107% cut off time. There was
            a visible sense of relief on his face as he said with
            the greatest of understatement, &quot; I am a touch
            disappointed but we are in the race.&quot; To be
            happy to qualify second to last, must be a hard pill
            to swallow for the current World Champion who won
            this race last year.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The session was
            stopped with 2 and a half minutes to go when <b>Nicola</b>
            <b>Larini</b> hit a wall leaving debris on the track
            and a mad rush ensued when 20 cars streamed from the
            pits to grab a last lap as the session restarted. A
            tussle for position outside the pits between
            Villeneuve and his team mate proved that sparks will
            indeed fly between these two in races to come and an
            inspired last lap from Frentzen brought him up from a
            miserable seventh to sit rather uncomfortably
            alongside the Canadian on the front row.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuves time of
            1.29.369 was almost a second faster than
            Frentzen&#146;s and another second quicker than the
            third place of Michael Schumacher. Had Villeneuve
            gone faster in his final lap, and it looked like he
            would have done had he not hit traffic, then Hill
            would definitely have been pushed into the 107% club
            and taken an early plane home. These are not good
            times for Damon and unless his team can sort
            themselves out, this reporter fears that he could
            become best friends with the<b> Lola</b> drivers-who
            both failed to qualify-in the 107% club canteen for a
            great deal of the season. <b>Rubens Barichello</b>
            finished an excellent 11th behind Berger and in front
            of <b>Ralph Schumacher</b>&#146;s <b>Jordan </b>showing
            a fine turn of speed in his first outing in the <b>Stewart
            Ford</b>. The Jordans falling further down the grid
            than both <b>Eddie Jordan </b>and the <b>Peugeot</b>
            bosses would probably like.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the expected
            trouncing of the field by the Williams in the most
            emphatic manner, the expected opinions, regarding the
            most actively contested field for years, look like
            being way off the mark. Whilst it is early days yet,
            the front runners, Williams, Ferrari and McLaren seem
            set to dominate the season and the fighting for the
            remaining points looks set to be a rather scrappy
            affair. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The race could of
            course be different but when Villeneuve, blowing away
            the smoke screens of secrecy from the Williams pit
            door says &quot;We could have gone quicker at the
            end&quot;, you know that he will give no quarter and
            he already has the Championship sewn up. This will
            indeed be sad for Formula one if the level of
            competition remains as it was today.</font></p>
