            to the crowd, was not a standing ovation for the
            players, but a boo and a hiss to the villain of the
            piece. Drama and tension were plentiful. There was
            luck, there was misfortune and there was <i>derring
            do</i> but in the end, F1 laid itself bare to the
            clinical gaze of both the uninitiated public and fans
            alike, revealing a darker underbelly of

            to be at and end. Having not finished the first three
            races of the season, Hill was faring low to dreadful
            and Walkinshaw was not a happy man. <i>&quot;We&#146;re
            at the time when we are seriously considering our
            drivers for next season and his performances speak

            quite obvious to any one who has been watching the
            team closely that we aren&#146;t satisfied.
            We&#146;re not satisfied with his performance and nor
            should he. He has had too many accidents,
            particularly in the early laps and he hasn&#146;t

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill&#146;s
            performance rating has indeed been poor this year but

            than his own rather wayward judgement that he ended
            up with a team that he should have joined last year.
            In phrasing disquietingly similar to that which he
            made from TWR&#146;s Leafield base last year, Hill
            said,<i> &quot;I am absolutely delighted to be

            forced his older brother off the track and into an
            early retirement at a crucial point in the
            championship. Belligerent, as he was regarded by many
            in the pit lane, he said, <i>&quot;It was a normal

            a non German to take the honours, was a pretty slim
            one at the beginning of the weekend, with the
            brothers Schumacher in fine form and a highly charged
            but poorly performing <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b>,
            desperate to soothe the ever shortening tempers of
            his Williams bosses. But a rejuvenated <b>Gerhard
            Berger</b>, returning to Benetton after his three
            race absence with a decision to look for fresh fields
            next season, shared the front row of the grid with <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b>, the young driver who will replace him
            and<i> then</i> showed him a clean pair of heels for
            the entirety of the race. In a weekend, where all the
            talk was of <i>&#145;young blood&#146;</i> drivers,
            hungry for the spoils of their elders and at a
            fraction of the cost, the dinosaurs roared back with
            a show of strength that proved experience can, on
            occasion, be worth more than motivation. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finishing 17 seconds
            ahead of <b>Michael Schumacher</b> after having
            driven a precise and intelligent race, an emotional
            Berger said, <i>&quot;I really felt I had some
            special power here this weekend. I knew when I came
            back that all the Media sharks were waiting to get
            some negative headlines and I wanted to show them
            that it&#146;s different and I did it.&quot;</i> The
            Austrian National Anthem played for the first time in
            two years, ironically at the same circuit where
            Berger had his last victory and he no doubt he shed a
            private tear, thinking that his father would have
            been overjoyed by the occasion had he been there to
            witness it.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With Schumacher
            rapidly overtaking the Canadian in the points race,
            it seemed that Villeneuve was on a suicidal mission
            to scupper any chance that he had of clinching an
            early championship title. In an interview published
            in the German Publication <i>&#145;Der Spiegel&#146;</i>
            he claimed that the new rules designed to curb the
            ever increasing speed of Formula one cars, were
            &#145;shit&#146;. <i>&quot;I think it's going to take

            of still being the ultimate sport that it is, it's
            going to become more of a show and a circus.&quot; </i>Villeneuve
            had always advocated the &#145;fun&#146; aspect of
            driving and &#145;taking things to the edge&#146; and
            firmly believed that the FIA was going in the wrong
            direction with its rules regarding grooved tyres and
            a narrower car width. <i>&quot;We need bigger tires
            and 70% smaller wings,&quot;</i> he said, <i>&quot;There's
            no longer any difference between Monaco and a 160

            undeniably dazzling win, a shadow of doubt still
            existed as to Frentzen&#146;s consistent race winning
            capabilities. With the real yard stick having retired
            and his fellow countryman (Schumacher) driving a car
            (Ferrari) lacking the outright speed of the Williams,
            yet finishing less than a second and a half behind,
            the German had still to be the hunter and win
            regularly, against his team mate and the only man

            with cars looking pretty for their brief posing time
            on the grid, the not totally unexpected happened. A
            downpour of severe proportions 15 minutes before the
            start, turned the track into an inky black slick and
            parts into a shallow swimming pool. <b>Schumacher</b>
            proved yet again his mastery in the wet, by
            dominating the race from the first lap. The

            taking the mid and back field under its wing. Its
            rain tyres were supposedly worth over a second a lap
            on the tried and tested <b>Goodyear</b>s, but then
            the top four or five Goodyear-shod drivers in the top
            four or five teams were worth that also and then some

            rankings, but still generating positive comment and
            no doubt made some of its lesser teams look a lot
            better than they actually were. The decision by <b>Goodyear</b>
            to pull out of F1, has without doubt been influenced
            by <b>Bridgestone</b> who are quite prepared to take
            on the American Company&#146;s burden of supplying
            the whole grid in 1999. </font></p>

            overtake, seemed to deliberately and sharply alter

            67 year old F1 ringmaster, had also issued a stern
            pre- race warning to both Championship contenders and
            threatened severe repercussions if it came to dirty
            driving on the track. <i>&quot;The guilty party can

            their wallets, if they step out of line,&quot;</i> he
            said. <i>&quot;Accidents do occur in the heat of the
            moment, especially when there is so much at stake,
            but we don't want them to do anything silly. Past

            another off and it must not happen again.&quot;</i>
            These as it turned out were hollow threats.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the heat of the
            moment, these fine words had been ignored. Yet to
            their eternal shame the <b>FIA</b> when it came down
            to sanctions, repercussions and punishment, let the
            perpetrator off the hook with what amounted to a mere
            smack on the wrist in a show of toothless neglection
            of their roll as governing body of a sport that needs
            to be ruled with a rod of carbon fibre. To sanction
            Schumacher by banning him as Ecclestone threatened to
            do, from the first few races of &#146;98, would have
            been the natural thing to do, but it would only
            highlight the current lawlessness of Formula 1, and
            fuel controversy as it has done over the closed
            season. This would please nobody and the sport found
            itself saddled with a <i>&#145;Jerezgate&#146;</i>
            that, like <i>Adelaide</i> in 1994 refused to go
            away. Had Schumacher got away with it and put the
            Canadian out or, if they had both gone out, he would
            have won the Championship and the penalty would have
            been severe. As it was he only hurt himself and it
            was the ultimately his heaviest cross to bear. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">However his name being
            excluded from the 1997 championship tables, was
            hardly any punishment at all. To Schumacher coming
            second or twenty second is of no consequence. He
            didn&#146;t win and that was an end to it. The fact
            that he was allowed to keep all his race wins and
            points made a mockery of the scoring system and with
            five race wins to his name and 78 points still in his
            personal CV it will seem like a ghost had been
            driving to future historians of Formula 1. His name
            still appears in championship listings in second
            place under Villeneuve along with his race wins. The
            only difference is that there is no positional number
            beside it.</font></p>

            attempt to exclude the impending total tobacco
            sponsorship ban of all sporting events from Formula
            1. The payment was made by Ecclestone in January
            after a colleague had asked him to make a donation. <i>&quot;I

            that <i>David Mills</i>, husband of the Minister for

            international motor racing events. Both Cuba and
            Russia want in and it looks like China and Malaysia
            will be hosting events in 1999 now that the future of

            Senna died when he lost control of his Williams car
            and hit a wall at the Tamburillo curve in the <i>San
            Marino Grand Prix</i> in 1994. A fractured steering
            column was allegedly the cause of the accident and
            six people all of whom had some direct input into the
            incident, were put on trial at a makeshift courtroom
            at Imola. <b>Frank Williams</b>(director),<b> Patrick
            Head </b>and<b> Adrian Newey</b> (the two technicians
            of the Williams team who had designed and carried out
            the modifications to the steering column), <i>Roland

            and <i>Giorgio Poggi</i> (members of the management
            of the Imola circuit)all walked away without blame.</font></p>

            Costanza to read the nine lines absolving all
            defendants of blame. The judge referred to article
            530 of the code of penal procedure (acquittal), which
            states that if someone did not commit &#145;the
            fact&#146; then he can&#146;t be found guilty of it.</font></p>

            heeded, less safe. The narrower width of the cars and
            grooves in the tyre tread, will make the cars
            considerably slower and less controllable. Motor
            sports governing body the FIA regard these safety
            measures as imperative to reduce the risk of fatal
            accidents and to make racing more exciting.
            Villeneuve has often been outspoken in his comment
            regarding the new rules and how there is now <i>&#145;no
            fun&#146;</i> in driving a Formula 1 car.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So it all comes round
            full circle. The new cars will be launched in the
            first month or so of the new year, to trumpets and
            flashing lights and huge amounts of optimism. The
            drivers and team bosses will all express their hopes
            for the season in the most positive way and the press
            will go and write their reports that all end with
            hopes for a truly exciting season, indeed &#145;the
            most exciting season for years&#146;. Cynicism aside,
            so it could well be, as the yardstick has yet to be
            calibrated. With all pointers set at zero it will be
            down to the teams and drivers with the fastest
            learning curves to get their new designs to work on
            the track. This will obviously be the teams with the
            biggest budget and again we can be assured that
            Williams will set the pace along with <i>McLaren</i>
            and <i>Ferrari</i>. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Damon Hill</b>
            freshly &#145;Jordanised&#146; has every chance of
            bettering his 1997 performance although the <b>Mugen-Honda</b>
            which will power the Silverstone team, has only ever
            taken a single victory and that one by <b>Olivier
            Panis</b> at <i>Monaco</i> driving a <strong>Prost</strong>
            (nee <i>Ligier</i>) in the rain in 1996 was because
            all the top contenders fell by the wayside in the
            atrociously wet conditions. With the tight French
            connection between <b>Alain Prost</b> and <b>Peugeot</b>,
            victory could be but a few races away although a
            season or so is a more realistic evaluation.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One team fell by the
            wayside this year almost before it started and one
            team announced it&#146;s arrival for the &#145;99
            season. What the failed <b>Lola</b> team didn&#146;t
            have, the big and burgeoning <b>Reynard Racing</b>
            team has. Huge cigarette sponsorship to enable them
            to engulf a small team - in this case </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial"> - and the ability to induce
            faith into their backers. To enter F1 you have to be
            standing on a pile of notes that looks exactly like
            £50 million. This should guarantee you a year&#146;s
            stress free racing, but <strong>Lola</strong>'s pile
            just wasn't high enough and sparked off new FIA rules
            forcing new teams to deposit vast amounts of cash up
            front to show intent. This would be returned in a
            trickle by the FIA over the course of their first two
            participatory years. Who gets the interest remains to
            be seen. It also makes the FOCA look like a solvent
            bunch of professionals and the impending
            &#145;floatation&#146; of Ecclestone&#146;s private
            property that is F1, on the stock market, could
            re-burnish the sport&#146;s tarnished edges. Having
            suffered it&#146;s <i>&#145;annus miserabilis&#146; </i>Formula
            1 has now to look forward to a new honesty and a
            simplicity that keeps itself on track. The public
            will only stand so much and the fat cats and
            governing bodies could find themselves with the most
            expensive toy in the world with no one to watch them
            play.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It will be a different
            brand of Champagne being poured with such vulgar
            gusto at the end of each race next season as Moet
            have now withdrawn their sponsorship on the grounds
            that it &#145;cheapens&#146; the value of their
            product. Formula 1 will no doubt hold it&#146;s
            collective breath and close it&#146;s eyes tight as
            the race motor homes are erected in Melbourne on
            March 8th. How Schumacher enters the fray, will be
            scrutinised by the world, his mood will be noted and
            his driving will be criticised no matter how he
            performs.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Formula 1 has taken a
            severe knocking this year and the &#145;good
            times&#146; have to return to the paddock. For the
            world to keep watching to entice sponsors to stay in
            the sport, their has to be a strong governing body to
            back up the rules that it makes. This is the backbone
            of motor sport. The fracas of 1997 must never happen
            again. The circus has been given a clean bill of
            health with the exorcisation of the ghost of Senna
            and it should concentrate now on making the events on
            the track as healthy as their sponsor&#146;s budgets.</font></p>
