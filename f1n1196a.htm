        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Frank Williams</b>
            who along with <b>Patrick Head</b> Chief Engineer At
            Williams Grand Prix Engineering and several other
            team members including the out-going Aerodynamicist, <b>Adrian
            Newey</b>, is expecting to be formally charged this
            week in connection with the death of <b>Ayrton Senna</b>
            at the San Marino GP at Imola in 1994. Whilst the prosecution&#146;s
            case is based on the fact that the welding on a
            modified steering shaft was faulty, causing the
            crash, Williams was reported to have said that,
            &quot;everything was working properly&quot;. In a
            statement earlier this year, he stated that it was
            the crash and not faulty welding that had in fact, broken
            the steering column. The theory goes, that debris may
            have caused a puncture which could have led to Senna losing
            control and, as previously stated, breaking the steering
            column on impact. If found guilty of manslaughter, a prison
            sentence is quite possible. Time and the Italian Cowboy
            courts will tell.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This of course raises
            the problems of racing in Italy in the future. There
            is talk of curtailing all FIA promoted events in Italy
            if the case goes to court. The fact that a puncture
            or a loose chipping could lead to a whole team being
            jailed is too ridiculous to contemplate. The Italian
            Tifosi would not take kindly to having their sport
            withdrawn from them in this manner. In such matters
            they would all agree that death is natural and, when
            inevitable, honourable in Formula 1. The Judge will
            be in for a pasting and not only from the motoring press
            if Imola and Monza are struck from the Formula 1 calendar.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>John Watson </b>Ex
            Formula 1 driver, 2 times runner up to the World
            Championship and highly praised Eurosport commentator
            is moving to Indy Car with <b>Ben Edwards </b>now that
            the Channel has lost its&#146; Pan European rights to broadcast
            Formula 1 events. Whilst his voice will be sorely missed
            next season, he could bring some sense of meaning to
            the often senseless and naive commentary that we have to
            put up with currently. He plans to move to the US for
            the season.&nbsp;</font></p>

            first season of F1 coverage in March. Brundle
            however, is still sitting on his hands and waiting to
            see if Eddie Jordan reads to the bottom of his
            drivers list where his name currently lurks. Jordan
            it seems, is trying his best to keep Brundle from
            sniffing Carbon next season and is at present considering
            pulling Ex champ <b>Nigel Mansell</b> from the putting
            green (see seperate story).<b> Steve Rider</b>

            and &#145;British Competition Driver of the
            Year&#146; awards. Hill, in accepting the first,
            thanked all &#145;the people who support
            &#145;you&#146; and sit at home and agonize over whether
            it&#146;s going to turn out all right.&#146; His wife
            Georgie and indeed, his greatest supporter, accepted
            the second award from Jackie Stewart.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Nigel Mansell</b>
            is to Fly out to Barcelona next Wednesday (11th Dec)
            to Join the Jordan Peugeot team in two days of testing.
            The rumours of a comeback for the 43 year old Formula
            1 and Indy Car Champion, seem to be ripening, yet why
            Mansell should even contemplate a return to Formula 1 with
            a team that has yet to win a Grand Prix, is somewhat mystifying.
            Mansell said at Silverstone on Tuesday,
            &#145;I&#146;m grateful to Eddie for giving me the
            chance to get re-acquainted with a Formula 1
            car&#146;. The Kudos for Team Jordan and it&#146;s
            sponsors Benson &amp; Hedges is obvious, though
            Mansell will certainly not get paid anywhere near the amount
            that led him to an abortive season with McLaren in
            &#146;95, it is thought that the money set aside for
            Damon Hill will go into Mansell&#146;s pocket if the
            deal goes through.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mansell&#146;s return
            will not please many and a collective groan will be
            heard down the pit lanes of motor sport. It seems
            that the only thing bigger than his driving talent is
            his ego and whilst reporters and readers alike can
            accept the &#145;Royal We&#146; it is hard to feel
            sympathy when things go badly, as he so often blames
            everything and everyone except himself. Despite his
            whingeing, he has provided the spectator with some
            stunning drives and fully deserves to be taken extremely
            seriously no matter what car he drives, as long as,
            that is, he can get in it.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ferrari adopts a
            Sponsor: </b>After severing ties with McLaren,
            Marlboro cigarettes are to be officially integrated into
            Team Ferraris&#146; official title next season. The
            amount of scarlet paint used on the cars, lessens
            with each season as the financial benefits of Shell,
            Pioneer, Asprey&#146;s and Parent Company, Fiat serve
            to dilute not only the colour but the credibility of
            such a pedigree. The Cruel stripe of Marlboro accross
            the flanks of the prancing horse is seen as the final capitulation,
            by Ferrari, to the commercial forces that run the
            sport and is a public indication of the amount of
            money top driver Michael Schumacher has cost them.
            They will now be called &#145;Scuderia
            Ferrari-Marlboro&#146;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Sauber</b> is,
            after all going to get the 1996 Ferrari V10 engines.
            In response to a premature press release from Sauber
            two weeks ago stating that a deal had been cemented,
            Spokesman for Ferrari, <b>Giancarlo Baccini</b>, in a sour
            grapes response called the whole deal off, citing the Sauber
            press release as &#145;Too early&#146;. A change of
            heart and, no doubt, the money that will be paid by
            petrol giant Petronas for the power plants, led to a
            joint announcement agreeing the deal, late last week.
            A further sweetener for the Scuderia was the signing
            of Italian <b>Nicola Larini</b> as partner to Johnny
            Herbert for the &#146;97 season.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jos Verstappen </b>was
            trying to be cheerful recently when he announced that
            he had signed to drive for <b>Ken Tyrell&#146;s</b>
            team in &#146;97. Yet, in a statement that could not
            be taken in any other way than as
            &#145;resigned&#146;, Verstappen praised the &#145;excellent
            design and engineering skills&#146; of a
            &#145;compact&#146; and &#145;efficient team&#146;.
            Having lost both the Sauber and Jordan seats, he
            should feel lucky that he got his signature on anything
            that will at least get him onto the back of the grid. <b>Ken
            Tyrell</b> can feel lucky that he did not have to
            sign another Japanese to drive his cars in a racing
            situation. It does seem that it is a &#145;best of
            the rest&#146; situation and the barrel now bears the
            signs of being fully scraped.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tyrell</b> do have
            the advantage of course of not having Yamaha to hold
            them back next season. The lightweight engine
            &#145;let go&#146; more times than Renault, Peugeot
            and Ferrari put together. The plodding Ford
            &#145;customer&#146; engine whilst not quite so
            powerful, might at least get them to the finish and hence
            a point or two.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The Yamaha</b>
            legacy has now gone to the TWR Arrows team of <b>Tom
            Walkinshaw</b>. Initially it will undoubtedly slow the
            team&#146;s progress down, but TWR&#146;s engineering department
            is such that they could show Yamaha a thing or two
            about building F1 engines. The second half of the season
            should see a definite upswing as Yamaha hand over the
            development reins to TWR.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Other news in

            It is expected that Peugeot, currently powering the

            with results to date, will sign a new deal with Ligier
