            unexpected, but for all the negative press that the
            A1-Ring at Zeltweg has received in recent weeks, the
            newly reconstructed Osterreichring threw up a race of
            incidents that made it one of the more interesting
            outings of the season. Under threat from McLaren and
            Prost for the most part, Jacques Villeneuve drove a
            steady if unspectacular race to take a much needed
            ten points and bring him to just one point short of
            Michael Schumacher who finished sixth by the skin of
            his teeth passing Damon Hill on the last lap. <br>
            <br>
            Mika Hakinnen made a lightning start from the grid
            leaving Villeneuve struggling on colder tyres to slip
            and slide uphill into the first corner. The
            Bridgestone clad Prost of Jarno Trulli made an
            expeditious start also, passing the Canadian before
            the turn. By the third turn both the Stewart-Fords of
            Rubens Barichello and Jan Magnussen also sporting the
            ultra grippy Bridgestone tyres started to harry the
            Williams and a fine pass by Barichello would have put
            Villeneuve down in fourth had not Hakinnen&#146;s
            McLaren expired approaching the start-finish line at
            the end of the first lap. &quot;I had a very average
            start and lost a place to Mika.&quot; Said Villeneuve
            afterwards. &quot;Then Trulli got me under braking.
            We had a lot of fuel and somehow we couldn&#146;t get
            out of the corners very well compared to the
            Bridgestones. They (Goodyears) took a bit longer to
            heat up and Barichello got me on the first lap
            also.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Having lost pole by seconds the day before, the
            unfortunate Finn must have thought that his streak of
            bad luck had run it&#146;s course, but statistically
            it could only continue and the familiar scenario
            began to unfold once more as team mate David
            Coulthard began picking up the pieces. &quot;It looks
            like my engine failed.&quot; Said Hakinnen matter of
            factly. &quot;...and when that explodes the game is
            over.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Trulli&#146;s game was just beginning for he started
            to edge out a lead from Barichello at over half a
            second a lap and the first three cars began to
            separate from the rest of the field. Trulli reeled
            off an unbroken string of 10 fastest laps bringing
            his time down from an early 1:15.6s on lap 3 to
            1:13.2s by lap 21. <br>
            <br>
            Gerhard Berger meanwhile had started from the pit
            lane having seen an &#145;error&#146; light come on
            in his cockpit. He was waved through as the race
            commenced, promptly spun off on lap 2 but regained
            the race to run mostly at the back finishing a sad
            10th place at his home Grand Prix. <br>
            <br>
            Michael Schumacher did well to gain 3 places at the
            start and by lap 5 was closing in on 5th placed Heinz
            Harald Frentzen. With Coulthard running hard after
            Schumacher and Damon Hill only a couple of seconds
            behind the Scotsman, there was a gap of some 8
            seconds to the trailing Jordan-Peugeots of Ralf
            Schumacher and Giancarlo Fisichella. <br>
            <br>
            As the rubber content on the track surface increased,
            so it&#146;s grip improved, bringing the Goodyear
            tyres back into contention and it became clear that
            Magnussen was holding up all the cars from 5th
            onwards. On lap 23, his tyres finally working at full
            efficiency, Villeneuve found an easy way passed
            Rubens Barichello at turn 2 into 2nd place and
            commenced his charge after the distant Trulli. <br>
            <br>
            Both Stewarts running a two stop strategy, were the
            first to pit clearing the running for the quicker
            cars who started making time on the front two who
            were by now half a lap ahead. Villeneuve had cut
            Trulli&#146;s 11 second lead to under 7 seconds when
            the young Italian pitted giving the Williams
            it&#146;s first taste of freedom at the front. This
            was the last time that the Stewarts were in
            contention. Rejoining in 13th and 14th place and with
            a further stop to come, they faded into obscurity,
            Magnussen retiring with a blown engine on lap 58 and
            Barichello, spinning off trying to catch Hill and
            defend his 7th position from the overtaking
            Schumacher at the same time, on lap 64. &quot;We had
            opted for a two stop strategy which is not what the
            leading teams pursued and that was the point at which
            the shape of the race changed.&quot; Said team
            director Paul Stewart. If they have a little to learn
            about strategy, they can none the less be pleased
            with their outing today and it bodes well for the
            rapidly improving Ford V10/Bridgestone combination
            for next year. <br>
            <br>
            The leader pitted on lap 37 rejoining behind
            Coulthard in 5th giving the Williams a temporary 1,2
            at the front with Schumacher now in a strong position
            to challenge for the lead as none of the top three
            had made their stops, a fast couple of laps in clean
            air and a second or two&#146;s advantage in the pit
            lane could decide the race. But it was all to change
            and it started with Alesi. <br>
            <br>
            A fairly innocent outside passing manoeuvre by Eddie
            Irvine on Jean Alesi at turn 2, produced a convincing
            reason for all F1 drivers to have their own pilots
            licence. Irvine had come up to Alesi carrying a full
            fuel load after pitting on lap37 and, giving the
            Frenchman a wide berth, had passed the Benetton when
            Alesi, either refusing to let go of his line or just
            losing control, slid into the Ferrari and launched
            itself into the air, across the nose of Irvine&#146;s
            car, narrowly missing his head, landing heavily in
            the gravel. &quot;He was heavy on fuel and I was
            light and he kept the inside.&quot; Said Irvine.
            &quot;I braked up around the outside and he stayed on
            the inside and then just gradually slid out and hit
            my front wheel and went over the top.&quot; Irvine
            has seen the underside of more cars than some
            mechanics in his career to date but this time it
            appeared that he was blameless. However as usual
            Alesi saw it differently. &quot;He tried to overtake
            me from the outside and suddenly I fly and I finish
            my race there!&quot; His ice blue eyes glowed with
            rage as he talked about the potential pasting he
            would impart to the nonchalant Irvine, should he find
            him in the Ferrari garage. &quot;It&#146;s as well I
            didn&#146;t find him otherwise it would surely have
            cost me a $10,000 fine because I am extremely angry
            about what he is doing. He&#146;s dangerous,
            he&#146;s extremely rude and I don&#146;t like this
            kind of attitude.&quot; Little should be read into
            the fiery Sicilian&#146;s statement as it is not the
            first time he has exploded with such vitriol in
            similar circumstances. <br>
            <br>
            As this mayhem occurred and the yellow caution flags
            came out, another innocent move, this time by
            Schumacher on Heinz Harald Frentzen, brought the
            German up to second and then into the lead as
            Villeneuve made his pit stop on lap 40. All the front
            runners then pitted around the same time giving
            Coulthard his brief turn at the front, Schumacher
            rejoining the race in 4th behind a light and quick
            Jordan of Giancarlo Fisichella who along with his
            team mate Ralf Schumacher, had made up huge amounts
            of time with the help of traffic and by leaving their
            pit stops till the last moment. <br>
            <br>
            With the top three positions seemingly settled, Jarno
            Trulli running magnificently behind Villeneuve, and
            Schumacher a creditable third after such a poor
            qualifying position, a 10 second stop and go penalty
            was awarded to the Ferrari driver for overtaking
            Frentzen under the yellow flag condition. &quot;This
            stupid thing with the yellow flag is a shame.&quot;
            Schumacher said. &quot;The problem was that I was
            following two cars and fighting very hard and I
            didn't notice any yellow flags as in my view they
            were only on the left hand side and I can&#146;t look
            through the cars. The flags should be more
            visible.&quot; Probably with the knowledge that he
            has got away without penalty before in a similar
            incident whilst testing at Monza, and angry with
            himself, he did however take his medicine gracefully,
            rejoining the race down and out of the points in 9th
            place. <br>
            <br>
            Schumacher then started his charge, frightening
            Barichello into removing himself from the track at
            the Jochen Rindt Kurve and setting his sights on the
            last remaining point held by Hill. &quot;The penalty
            made me angry.&quot; Said Schumacher later. &quot;I
            had to take risks. I had to go for it and Damon was
            clever enough not to risk a crash.&quot; Go for it he
            did, pushing the Arrows out of the way without a
            pause or backward glance, such was his intent.
            &quot;I saw Michael behind me and I thought he was
            far enough back that if I braked late enough he
            couldn&#146;t get through.... but he got
            through.&quot; With worn brakes and an underpowered
            Yamaha, he had no choice but to let the Ferrari go
            and the German disappeared amongst a sea of
            fluttering scarlet flags waved on by the Tifosi who
            had turned out in their thousands to cheer their hero
            on. &quot;I was driving my nuts of and I was braking
            later and later and had a soft pedal. I thought,
            &#145;bugger&#146;, he was able to brake later than
            me!&quot; It was as far as Schumacher could go. Next
            in line was his brother young Ralf and speculation
            was that, had he managed to get any closer, family
            ties might have allowed the red to pass the yellow,
            but it remains a tantalising scenario as the season
            nears it&#146;s climax in Spain next month. <br>
            <br>
            The Jordans did extremely well to finish 4th and 5th
            (Fisichella&#146;s 3rd 4th and Schumacher&#146;s 3rd
            5th of the season) after their disappointing
            qualifying times. Ever the smiling face of optimism
            even in defeat Fisichella said, &quot;I don&#146;t
            believe my result...I am very pleased. I drove very
            well too! The car was a little difficult at the start
            and then after 15 laps, I had hydraulic failure on
            the differential. I turned it off which meant I
            suffered a little in the slow corners. It was the one
            stop strategy plus a very good pit stop that helped
            me finish fourth.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Ralf Schumacher was not so happy. Constantly being
            upstaged by his team mate, he could say little in a
            positive vein in reply to the young Italian&#146;s
            jubilance. &quot;I am not completely satisfied with
            my own performance and because I started ahead of my
            team mate but finished behind him. I lost time in the
            pits because of a crossed wheel nut. I had a lot of
            traffic in the last three laps and nearly spun when I
            late braked twice. I was not able to pull ahead as
            much as I would have liked.&quot; Their positions
            give them a total of 33 points so far, 3 greater than
            they have ever achieved before which is cause for
            celebrations of some kind and clearly the team on
            present performance are set to take over
            Benetton&#146;s place as the fourth team of standing
            in the grid pecking order. <br>
            <br>
            With Schumacher out of the frame, Coulthard continued
            his slow progress through attrition, to the front. In
            a strange set of events, he was subjected to first
            the oil cloud of white smoke from Shinji
            Nakano&#146;s Prost as he was about to be lapped and
            moments later another oil cloud of exactly the same
            composition as the other Prost of Trulli&#146;s let
            go. In literally a puff of smoke, Coulthard found
            himself a reasonable safe second with an outside
            chance of catching Villeneuve to make it two wins in
            a row. &quot;It was a question of hanging on to the
            end.&quot; He said. &quot;Back-markers were a big
            problem, but it was a fairly straightforward
            race.&quot; It was indeed for him and despite being
            held up by Berger in his pursuit of the leader, he
            finished on the second step of the podium more by
            luck this time round than driving skills. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;This is a very important win for us.&quot; Said
            a jubilant Villeneuve. &quot;&quot;The positive thing
            is that we took nine points from Michael and the
            championship is looking much better now. We have a
            better package overall, and I am very confident for
            the rest of the season.&quot; Rarely does Villeneuve
            use the word &#145;I&#146; preferring the safety and
            comfort of &#145;we&#146; and it denotes a new air of
            seriousness about him that perhaps makes him realise
            that his is the championship to lose rather than win.
            Despite the single point difference the cards look
            set to be dealt his way and Schumacher, never
            complacent over William&#146;s temporary weakness,
            will recognise the urgency now to wrap the proceeding
            up. &quot;I think I could have finished second today
            without the penalty.&quot; He said finally. &quot;But
            at least I managed to pick up a point and If you tell
            from where I came, starting from ninth and coming
            sixth, I have a reason to be happy.... somehow.&quot;
            <br>
            <br>
            Villeneuve is more likely to make a mistake under
            pressure than Schumacher and it will be interesting
            to see how they conduct themselves on the track in
            the last three races of the season. For now everyone
            is happy up to a point. Hill&#146;s future is secure
            for two years at least with a potentially winning
            team, Villeneuve has bridged the psychological gap to
            take him to the edge of stardom and Schumacher,
            hanging on by his fingernails, still goes into the
            next round in the lead onto a track he knows well.
            The Luxembourg Grand Prix at the Nurburgring, will
            reveal more of both drivers&#146; resolves than ever
            before. <br>
