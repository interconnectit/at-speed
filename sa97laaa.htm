        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The new Sauber C16 was
            today launched in a rather eerie fashion with not a
            single member of the press present. Instead, down the
            telephone lines of a thousand journalists all over
            the world the disembodied words of Team manager <b>Peter
            Sauber</b>, designer <b>Leo Ress</b>, Team Director <b>Max Welti</b>,
            Head of engine development <b>Osamu Goto</b> and the two
            drivers, Englishman <b>Johnny Herbert </b>and Italian <b>Nicola Larini</b>,
            appeared on glowing TV monitors in 20 different countries.
            This is not the first time that the Internet has been used
            to launch a car, <b>Ferrari </b>launched on line last
            year complete with live pictures of the car. At this
            event today however, there was no car, just a rather
            dull looking group of people sitting at a modernish
            desk, cans of <b>Red Bull</b> to the fore. The
            ever-so-slowly changing pictures didn&#146;t really
            add to the rather frustrating atmosphere of the event
            and the questions via the standard Internet protocol
            of <b>IRC </b>were not exactly thick and fast and
            mostly seemed to be in German. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the help of a
            downloadable press release and what questions one
            could decipher, one got the general gist of the occasion
            and some information however scant, about the car
            itself:</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When asked to describe
            the latest creation of his design team in comparison
            to the previous model, Chief Designer Leo Ress gave a
            simple answer: &quot;Even smaller and slimmer, even a
            little bit more compact.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Indeed the <b>Red
            Bull-Sauber-Petronas C16,</b> is significantly narrower
            in the front area. Following the latest trend the
            front nose box with the integrated crash structure
            has been made even higher and narrower. Some visible
            changes have been made in the cockpit area which is
            also narrower around the side crash structure. And
            the lower cockpit side design is a result of the
            aerodynamic findings of last season. It aims to improve
            the air flow in the airbox area from where the engine receives
            the air it needs. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The rear of the car
            has not been spared from the general slimming diet.
            It is also narrower. Further significant changes are
            the so-called rear wings improving downforce which
            have been placed between the side pods and rear tyres,
            a place designated by the new <b>FIA</b> Technical Regulations.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All these
            modifications are the result of weeks of meticulous aerodynamic
            work on a 50% scale model of the C16 in the wind
            tunnel at the <b>Swiss National Airplane Works</b> in Emmen/Switzerland,
            having a rolling road in order to simulate the air
            flow between the road surface and the car&#145;s undertray.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All this can be
            considered normal in the development of a new race
            car. But the engine decision (the supply of &#146;96 version <b>Ferrari
            V10</b> engines) which was taken as late as November
            1996 dictated a construction and fabrication schedule
            for the cars which can be compared to an emergency
            operation. &quot;From the designer&#145;s point of
            view simply a nightmare,&quot; Leo Ress confesses.
            &quot;From the driver&#145;s seatback, up to the rear
            light, our work was sometimes a gamble.&quot;
            However, for Team Red Bull-Sauber-Petronas the two-year
            contract with the traditional Italian race outfit secures
            the access to highly modern engine technology based
            on Ferrari&#145;s experience.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It wasn&#145;t until
            December that all designers and engine specialists
            could hold their first meeting. With the information
            received there they start working through their long
            list of tasks. Everything in the Red Bull-Sauber-Petronas
            C16 situated behind the driver had to be defined and
            constructed in the shortest possible time. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;On January 20,
            1997 we completed the last drawings for the larger
            parts. When the last small details were designed and
            finalized, it was already the end of January,&quot;
            remembers Leo Ress clearly, in this extraordinary
            race against time.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">What remains are the
            designers&#145; worries that everything will function
            reliably and without any major problems at the first races
            of the season. But for the design team one thing is
            for sure: For the first time since their Formula One
            debut in the 1993 season Team Red
            Bull-Sauber-Petronas will not have to build a car
            around a completely new engine for next year.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Due to the nature of
            the medium, the questions fielded were inevitably
            fairly simplistic, however a few quotes were worthy of
            mention. When Osamu Goto was asked about engine supply
            he said<b> </b>&quot;Taking into consideration that
            you will need 2 new engines for each race, it will be
            a total of between 30 and 40 engines.&quot; He added,
            &quot;We will propose some changes to the engine
            because we have some ideas. Everything will be done
            together with Ferrari.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
            src="sac16mo1.jpg" width="215" height="156"></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This reporter asked
            Leo Ross whether he had considered <b>Bridgestone</b>
            tyres as part of what must be now, a rather hurried
            test programme due to the tardiness of the cars launch.
            He said &quot;Indeed due to the time left our test schedule
            is a very tight one. We will have to work very hard to
            catch up on testing mileage. The plan is to shake
            down the car from tomorrow in <b>Fiorano </b>and
            hopefully to do a second test next week in <b>Barcelona</b>,
            however our contract with <b>Goodyear</b> includes
            the 1997 season and we will fulfill this contract.
            Obviously we are following the situation on the tyre
            sector closely.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The drivers seemed a
            bit extraneous not being able to talk about their
            cars. I asked Johnny Herbert about his aspirations
            for the season. He was sensibly conservative in saying,
            &quot;For the first year with the new engine it is
            more important to get a good understanding for Mr.
            Ress and Mr. Goto to further develop the car. It is
            very difficult to finish in the top five, but that is
            what we all are aiming for. I think we have a very
            good opportunity to join the big teams. Our package
            should be strong and as the season progresses we can
            consistently get more points.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A final word or two
            was said by Team manager Peter Sauber before the plug
            was pulled on the session. &quot;For us this (Ferrari)
            agreement signifies the most important step ever since
            we decided to enter Formula One.&quot; He said,
            &quot;Not only have we got an absolutely competitive
            engine for the 1997 season that bears comparison, but
            we now also acquire engine competence thus finally
            allowing us to plan strategically in this area.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sauber do indeed seem
            to have a great package and even before the car turns
            a wheel it&#146;s digital &#145;launch&#146; gave the green
            light for unbridled optimism for the coming season.</font></p>
