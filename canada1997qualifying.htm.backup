            Local Home boy <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>&#146;s pole
            position was snatched from him in the final minute of
            qualifying. This time it was <b>Michael Schumacher</b>,
            taking his first pole for <b>Ferrari </b>since
            Hungary in 1996, who saw to it that the crowd of over
            a hundred thousand would not see their hero at the
            front of the grid.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The teams, reluctant
            to set an early pace, waited for over ten minutes
            into a rather dull session before sending the first
            car out amid the good-natured shouting of the crowd.
            The Mexican waves seemed to follow <b>Rubens
            Barrichello</b> round the circuit as he obligingly
            cleared away a lot of the dirt and dust to set the
            benchmark of 1.20.4s for others to follow.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Damon Hill</b>,
            victim yet again of &#145;that&#146; engine and a
            woefully ill-prepared team, set an early and
            unspectacular time of 1.20.12 in the <b>Arrows</b>,
            running the old &#145;C&#146; spec Yamaha after the
            latest spec engine let go on him the day before. No
            surprises there. It was to be his best time of the
            day, for he spun at turn 1 on his fourth lap and was
            forced to use the spare for the remainder of the
            session, suffering severe brake balance problems. <i>&quot;On
            my first run, I spun and it was my fault.&quot;</i>
            He said <i>&quot;Thankfully I got my time in as it
            was the only time I got for the rest of the session.
            The spare car had a braking problem and we had to
            come in and change that and the rest was down to
            traffic.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuve set the
            early pace with a 1.19.4 and it was then a succession
            of fastest laps for <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>, <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b>, <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen </b>and
            Schumacher, fighting his car all the way round the
            circuit, who all took their turn at the front. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a brief
            period of optimism for <b>McLaren</b> when <b>David
            Coulthard </b>using the <b>Mercedes V10 </b>evolution
            engine set a blistering 1.18.4, taking pole before
            his engine mysteriously died on him. The lead was
            retaken by Schumacher on his second run and then
            again to the riotous delight of the crowd, Villeneuve
            put in what looked like the definitive lap of
            1.18.1s.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With a little over
            five minutes remaining <b>Alexander Wurz</b> sitting
            in for <b>Benetton</b>&#146;s ailing <b>Gerhard
            Berger</b>, kissed the concrete wall a little to
            amorously coming out of the final turn on to the pit
            straight and lost his wheel. The session was
            red-flagged to allow his stricken car to be removed
            from the track and the final few minutes saw a gaggle
            of cars leaving the pit lane for one last outing.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Coulthard in the
            spare, ruined his chances by over driving his car
            into the grass, wrecking his tyres for his final lap.
            Hill, suffering from severe handling problems was,
            not for the first time, holding up Rubens Barrichello
            in the queue of cars all desperate to get round to
            the start finish line before the chequered flag fell
            on the session. Somehow he managed to get though and
            set an extraordinary lap to move up five places on
            the grid to third. <i>&quot;I am absolutely
            thrilled,&quot; </i>He grinned <i>&quot;&quot;The
            Ford project 6 engine has much more power and
            driveability. Our car is very strong aerodynamically,
            so we can afford to run with a very low wing and its
            still steady under braking.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With less than ten
            seconds to go, both Villeneuve and Schumacher crossed
            the line to start their final charges. The Canadian
            was uncharacteristically sloppy, using up all the
            available track space to hold his car in check until
            a severe brake lock put and end to bettering his
            time, leaving Schumacher to take the honours by 3
            thousandths of a second. <i>&quot; Sure I&#146;m
            disappointed. The same thing happened last year on
            the last lap.&quot;</i> Villeneuve said afterwards. <i>&quot;I
            got into turn 1 locking the wheels. You&#146;re just
            turning all the time and you can&#146;t adjust your
            brake bias. I braked a bit early and I lost a few
            tenths. I am very confident for tomorrow as our car
            is very strong on high fuel loads.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Michael Schumacher of
            course, had seen the chinks in the <b>William&#146;s</b>
            armour and not swayed by the team&#146;s apparent
            sandbagging, knew he had a chance if he was careful.<i>
            &quot;I didn&#146;t go with any expectations, but
            after this morning, it showed a little bit that we
            had a slight chance.&quot;</i> He explained in his
            unique &#145;Schumacherese&#146;. <i>&quot;Tyres will
            be a bit critical but if you know how to handle them
            and are aware of this, you should be able to deal
            with it.&quot; </i>A small pearl of wisdom from the
            maestro and one that should be heeded, for whilst
            tyres will not be as critical as in Spain, criticism
            has been placed at <b>Goodyear&#146;</b>s door for
            excessive wear on some rear sets. <b>Bridgestone</b>
            apparently are consistent throughout the range and
            have been hearing nothing but praise. It is odd
            therefore to see regular Bridgestone front runner <b>Olivier
            Panis</b> so far down the grid in 10th place. <b>Paul
            Stewart</b> Director of the highest placed
            Bridgestone team <b>Stewart Ford</b> said, <i>&quot;
            We feel confident in another superb performance by
            Bridgestone which will make our planning far
            easier.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Disappointing too for <b>Jordan
            Peugeot</b> after posting such promising times
            yesterday but refusing to be downhearted, Giancarlo
            Fisichella, who qualified ten places higher in sixth,
            than he did last year for <b>Minardi</b>, said,<i>
            &quot;I was still improving my time on the last lap
            so this is encouraging. The problems we have been
            having with tyre wear have improved, but we still
            have some work to do after we have looked at the
            telemetry data from today.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Team mate Ralf
            Schumacher broke second gear during the session and
            liked his spare car so much that he <i>&#145;decided
            to race in it tomorrow.&#146;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It looks that this
            will not be a walkover for Young Villeneuve. Not only
            will Schumacher be filling the frame, but Coulthard,
            Barrichello and maybe Fisichella too will all want a
            slice of the maple pie. </font></p>
