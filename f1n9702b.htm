            <p><font face="Arial">The <b>Benson and HedgesTotal
            Jordan Peugeot</b> team today successfully completed
            its four day test of the Jordan Peugeot 197 in Jerez
            Spain. The dramatically coloured yellow and black car completed
            a total of 129 laps with the driving split between <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b> (Friday. Saturday. Sunday and <b>Ralf
            Schumacher</b> (Monday).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">With Ralf Schumacher suffering
            from flu, Giancarlo Fisichella took to the wheel on
            Friday 7th February, reversing the scheduled testing
            order. His first impressions of the car were good.
            &quot;The car has good downforce and grip, he
            commented &quot;and overall it feels very
            promising&quot; Unfortunately time lost with seat
            fittings and solving an electronic problem, and the
            day&#146;s testing finished earlier than planned due
            to a lower wing problem. A total of 17 laps were
            completed.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">On Saturday 8th Feb testing
            continued with Fisichella under windy and dusty
            conditions. The team concentrated on improving oil
            pick-up for the engine, running maximum and minimum
            oil levels and on obtaining data for Peugeot. The
            rear wing problem persisted, so that testing was
            limited to short laps. And a total of 20 were
            completed, with a fastest time of 1.23.30.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Sunday 9th Feb proved to be a
            very productive day of testing. Changes to the seat
            and pedals to make Fisichella more comfortable,
            together with a modified rear wing sent from the UK
            to solve the problems experienced in the previous
            days, meant that 47 laps were completed in a best
            time of 1.21.85 (with the ear running with reasonable amounts
            of fuel). Work was also completed on the active
            differential.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Today, Monday 10th Feb Ralf
            Schumacher completed 45 laps under warm (65 decrees
            F) and less breezy Conditions. During the morning session,
            in accordance with Peugeot engine testing, an excess
            of a race distance was completed with no problems,
            with Schumacher setting best time of 1.21 64. The
            engine The engine was changed over lunchtime but unfortunately
            problems were experienced with the second engine and
            only five laps were completed in the afternoon. Ralf
            Schumacher, however, was very pleased with his day at
            the track, saying he felt confident about the car and
            that he fully agreed with the comments made last week
            by Fisichella.</font></p>
