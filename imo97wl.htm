            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><u>The Winners</u></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Heinz-Harald
            Frentzen: </u>Oh, what joy, what bliss. He did it.
            All on his own. Didn&#146;t put a foot wrong. Lovely.
            Frank almost looked happy. (jump to <i>Losers</i>)</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Michael Schumacher:</u>
            Great race, took it right up to them, stayed with
            them, gave Heinz-Harald a fantastic scare on the last
            lap. The Ferrari is finally coming good and doing the
            business for which it is intended &#150; making
            Michael Schumacher look good. Jean Todt is finally
            seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Eddie Irvine:</u>
            It just gets better and better. Eddie ran a good
            race, staying out of trouble and giving the <i>tifosi
            </i>some fun after they watched the number 5 Ferrari
            pass. His duel with Fisichella was a classic bout and
            worth the air time it got.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Damon Hill:</u> For
            stuffing it up Shinji Nakano&#146;s behind. Hill has
            always been diplomatic to the point of boredom but
            this time, as when Taki Inoue bothered him at Monza
            in &#146;95, he let rip. He was a damnably cranky
            man, and rightly so. TWR&#146;s reputation must be in
            tatters and this is Hill&#146;s first (public)
            dummy-spit, remarkable for the controlled aggression
            with which it was delivered. Shinji, while being a
            quiet fellow, was in his way, so Damon gave him a
            wake-up call and it ended in tears. My first reaction
            was that of temporary brain fade, but I think Damon
            tried to avoid him, but then thought, &quot;What the
            hell, I&#146;m going nowhere.&quot; Here&#146;s why
            he was a winner: he was completely unrepentant. Well
            done, Damon, those pesky backmarkers won&#146;t get
            in your way again, and Tom definitely got the
            message, I would venture to say.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Giancarlo
            Fisichella: </u>For willing to stay behind an
            expiring Mercedes-Benz and brilliantly jumping out of
            the way when she finally blew. He deserved a podium
            after Ralf&#146;s shenanigans in Argentina, but he
            still got a good result and some airtime for the
            Peugeot engines. Keep praying, Eddie, keep praying.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Johnny Herbert:</u>
            What a champion. He was never very far away from the
            action and it was a crying shame when the thing let
            go. Sigh. Poor old Johnny. He didn&#146;t even bother
            to trudge back to the pits to be molested by ITV (see
            <i>losers</i>). Not a centenary GP to remember.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><u>The Losers:</u></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Us:</u> When are
            ITV going to get it right? They were only an hour and
            a half from home and they still couldn&#146;t get it
            right. And Australians had to put up with Dazza and
            Alan hopelessly trying to pad the empty bits. They
            did their best, but it&#146;s hard when you&#146;re
            sitting in a studio ten thousand miles away. At least
            we got to hear Damon chucking a tanty.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>TWR Arrows:</u>
            Hoo-boy, what a mess. Most specifically, that poor
            bastard who designed the throttle actuator. I&#146;m
            way out of line, here, but hey, guys, what about
            designing a <i>new </i>one. Hmmm? Or using last
            year&#146;s? Or getting your crap together and
            sorting yourselves out?</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Pedro Diniz and his
            merry band of difficult backmarkers:</u> Get out of
            the way, you people. Why is Imola a place where
            people insist on getting in the way? It&#146;s very
            simple. Ferraris, Williams, McLarens and Jordans are
            faster. Move out of way, don&#146;t get black-flag
            (that&#146;s wishful thinking, isn&#146;t it?) or
            world-champion burying his right-front into your
            back-behind. The marshals are partly to blame for
            this as they are not using they&#146;re brains even a
            teeny-tiny bit. Blue flags appear to be saved for the
            end when they wave any flag they can get their hands
            on.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Shinji Nakano:</u>
            For being in the wrong place, blocking the wrong
            bloke, at the wrong time.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Stewart-Ford
            Collectively: </u>Never mind, boys. Your car
            obviously handles alright and Monaco is on the way.
            The Ford engine might get you up the hill a few
            times, but I&#146;d still hold your breath.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Heinz-Harald
            Frentzen:</u> For bleating about the brakes in the
            press conference. Don't try to make a point, Heinz,
            you won. Stop being such a sod. Damon Hill didn't
            bitch like that and he isn&#146;t bitching now, so
            pipe down. Even Jacqes Villeneuve wasn't too cranky.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Jacques Villeneuve:</u>
            Oh, well. Playing the hard man in Australia has cost
            you very dearly. Now you know how Damon felt in '95.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Benetton-Renault:</u>
            Jean Alesi, Gerhard Berger, mix in the shadow of
            Michael Schumacher, Jean Alesi's now legendary
            stupidity and you have it right there. No more need
            be said, take from this what you will. </font></p>
