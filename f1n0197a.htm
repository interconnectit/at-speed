            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Formula 1 News
            Update Jan 7th 1997</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Damon Hill </b>has
            been awarded an OBE in the New Year's Honours List.
            First to congratulate him was, typically, <b>Murray
            Walker</b>. Hill himself seems to have avoided media attention.
            If he actually says anything in the future about it we'll
            report it&#133;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The date has been set
            for Team boss <b>Frank Williams</b> and employees <b>Patrick
            Head</b> and <b>Adrian Newey</b> to stand trial for
            Manslaughter over the death of driver <b>Ayerton
            Senna</b>. They are to appear before a judge in Imola
            on Feb 20th 1997. <b>Roland Bruinseraede</b> the race
            director and an FIA official is to face the same
            charges. They could face a maximum jail term of seven
            years but the &#145;best legal advice&#146; according
            to FIA President <b>Max Mosley</b> himself a
            barrister suggested that they would be acquitted.
            Whilst not ruling out a total ban on future
            participation in FIA governed racing events in Italy
            - if the Italian legal system regarding accidental
            deaths during races was not clarified before the start
            of the season on March 9th - Mosley said that
            &#145;there may be difficulty persuading competitors
            from outside Italy to participate.&#146;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Bernie Ecclestone</b>
            President of the Formula 1 Constructors Association
            said that he was &#145;hoping that the Italian Government
            will look at their law and bring it into line with other
            countries. It is not realistic to threaten a ban on
            motor racing in Italy, but I doubt if any team would
            want to go there and race knowing that they could end
            up in the nick&#146;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Williams Grand Prix
            Engineering have yet to be allowed more than a
            cursory glance at their car, still impounded in Italy,
            yet have had to surrender all computer data and video recordings
            they hold that are relevant to the crash, to the Italian
            courts</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After his brief taste
            of life in the fast lane, <b>Nigel Mansell</b> has
            declined the opportunity of competing with Eddie
            Jordan&#146;s team for next season. After leaving the
            Barcelona test session bubbling with enthusiasm, his
            decision not to race may have been influenced by FOC
            president <b>Bernie Ecclestone</b> who was quoted as
            saying, &#145;Mansell in a Williams could have made a
            nuisance of himself, but in any other car, he would
            be really struggling.&#146; Mansell&#146;s statement
            predictably made no mention of this, instead he declared
            that he &#145;could n0o longer devote the time necessary
            for a formula 1 season, due to other commitments.&#146;
            He declined to say that the Jordan car had no winning chances.
            This probably means that Brundle will be Schumaker&#146;s
            teammate. A disappointed <b>Eddie Jordan </b>still
            thinks that Mansell &#145;could still be a winner&#146;
            and said that &#145;The door will always be open for
            him.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The appearance in the
            frame of <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b>, could soften
            the blow for Jordan and add further to the
            frustration of long suffering <b>Martin Brundle </b>who
            is desperately holding on to the hope of taking back
            his place in the team.&#146;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Oil giant <b>Texaco</b>
            is to place £12 million in sponsorship money with <b>ITV </b>when
            it commences coverage of the new season in March
            1997. The deal is worth £4 million a year over the
            next three years for coverage of at least 192 programmes including
            qualifying and race updates.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Texaco is also part of
            the package that is funding the new <b>Jackie Stewart </b>Grand
            Prix team making its debut in 1997.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a ripple of
            bad feeling amongst the contenders for the <b>BBC
            Sports Personality of the Year</b> recently. <b>Damon Hill</b>
            the winner for the second time in three years, was deemed
            to be less worthy than 4 times Olympic Gold medal Rower <b>Steve
            Redgrave </b>or championship Jockey <b>Frankie Dettori</b>.
            Despite Hill himself personally endorsing Redgrave, Redgrave
            himself was none to happy about being runner up. He
            was after all &#145;only a rower&#146;. The BBC
            ironically gave their award to a sport that they will
            have little or no coverage of in 1997.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Black boxes will be
            fitted to all Formula 1 cars next year. Similar to
            the Flight Data Recorders fitted to all civil
            aircraft, the system will provide information about
            the performance and functioning of a car immediately
            prior to an accident. Delco Electronics who designed
            the box hope that it could prevent protracted
            investigations like that of the Death of Ayrton Senna
            almost three years ago and only now about to be
            resolved.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a recent interview
            with French magazine &#145;Auto Hebdo&#146; <b>Tom
            Walkinshaw</b>, Boss of the revamped <b>TWR/Arrows team</b>,
            predicted that Hill was capable of at least two Grand Prix
            wins in the coming season. Despite high optimism for the
            new chassis and<b> Bridgestone</b> tyres, as reported
            in <b><i>&#145;Speed&#146; </i></b>earlier this year
            the <b>Yamaha V10</b> is an unproven power unit and
            has been an extremely unreliable beast for Tyrell
            over the last two years.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Damon Hill TWR&#146;s
            prestigious signing, attempted to cool Walkinshaw&#146;s
            exuberance by saying that he wasn&#146;t going to go
            out and win the first race but, &#146;we could be up
            there fighting at the front occasionally&#146;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After all the media
            activity of Mansells showing at the winter testing in
            Barcelona, Williams driver <b>Jacques Villeneuve </b>unsurprisingly
            showed fastest times beating ex team mate Damon
            Hill&#146;s race time by seven tenth of a second.
            This came in the wake of the grumbling by Villeneuve,
            that the new version Renault RS9 was not appreciably quicker
            than the old RS8. Williams new &#145;Wunder Kind&#146; <b>Heinz
            Harald Frentzen</b>, unhappy with his laid back
            driving position could do no better than 6th overall
            behind the<b> McLaren </b>of <b>Coulthard</b>. With <b>Irvine</b>
            in fourth in the <b>Ferrari</b>, second and third
            places went to the hard working <b>Benneton</b> team, <b>Berger</b>
            being half a second quicker than <b>Jean Alesi</b>.</font></p>

            will not be the nominated test circuit for Title holders
            Team Williams next year. As required in the FIA rules,
            teams have to nominate a single venue for testing throughout
            the season. <b>Barcelona</b> will be used instead. It
            is believed that it will be used as a bargaining
            point in negotiations for the 1998 calendar. FIA will
            drop this ruling in exchange for 20 races in 1998.
            The teams have agreed to 18. <b>Silverstone</b> is
            also to have a new sponsor in the <b>Royal Automobile
            Club</b> for the nex three years.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As reported in <b><i>&#145;Speed&#146;</i></b>
            last week, <b>Lola</b>, another new team for 1997 has
            hired Italian <b>Vincenzo Sospiri</b> and <b>Ricardo Rosset</b>
            drive for 97. The Sospiri contract plus options, is believed
            to be for 4 years. Sospiri was F3000 champion in 1995
            and was test driver at Benetton this year. Rosset, second
            Arrows driver to <b>Jos Verstappen</b> in &#146;96 is believed to
            have been hired as part of Lola&#146;s contractual
            obligation to Major Sponsors<b> Master Card</b> to
            hire a Brazilian driver. The new car is scheduled for
            unveiling on Feb 1st.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Scheduled car
            launches: The <b>Arrows</b> should be launched on 9
            January at the <b>Birmingham Motor Show</b>. Both
            Hill and Diniz will be on hand to pull off the sheet.
            It is expected that it will be given a brief shakedown
            at Silverstone the following day before being
            exported somewhere more exotic for evaluation and
            tweaking. Ferrari is scheduled for January 7. <b>Sauber</b>
            will be launching in February as they are behind with
            the design of the C16 due to late negotiations to use <b>Ferrari</b>
            power. Until recently the team didn't know if they would
            be carrying a V8 or V10. Engine type and weight has a
            big effect on locating the car's center of gravity and
            setting up the desired wheelbase.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Adrian Newey</b>
            will go to McLaren early in 1997. It is reported that
            he will be earning more than current highest rolling
            car designer, <b>John Barnard</b>. A figure in excess
            of $3 million was mentioned.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ann Bradshaw</b>,
            much praised public relations officer for Team
            Williams is obviously missing her &#145;favourite

            position with Damons new bosses Tom Walkinshaw
            Racing. She will be missed by Williams, providing as
            she did, the very important link between the media,
            team activities and personalities. This will no doubt
            be influential in increasing Hill&#146;s
            &#145;comfort zone&#146; and to a
            &#145;seamless&#146; integration into his new team.</font></p>

            with <b>Fisichella</b>, another possibility, looking through

            the major Sponsors of the GP would be banned but all

            thought that merely &#145;covering up&#146; or
