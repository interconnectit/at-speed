            you need at Hockenheim - power, power and more
            power.&quot;</i> <em><b>Mike Gascoyne, Deputy
            Technical Director, Tyrrell Racing</b></em></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The crowds will have
            already gathered, laden with Heineken and Bitberger,
            turning the lonely and rather daunting forests
            surrounding the track at <i>Hockenheim</i> into a
            small city of tents and boisterous bon hommerie. With
            no less than three home boys driving in this
            weekend&#146;s race, the atmosphere will equal that
            which the <i>Tifosi</i> create for their beloved
            Ferrari in Italy. With a real chance that Michael
            Schumacher could clinch a third driver&#146;s
            championship and an even better one of winning the
            race, flares, fireworks and flags will be out in
            force. No German has ever won his home Grand Prix
            since the Championship competitions started in 1951,
            so, should Michael or his younger brother Ralf or <b>Heinz
            Harald Frentzen</b>, badly in need of motivation,
            manage to set foot on the podium there may even be a
            national holiday.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Built in 1929 amid the
            flat woodlands in the Valley of the Rhine, South West
            of Heidelburg, <i>Hockenheim</i> was used as a test
            track for <b>Mercedes</b>, but was overshadowed by
            the <i>Nurburgring</i> and post war racing only
            commenced in the early &#145;50&#146;s. They say that
            <i>Hockenheim</i> has no soul, being put to use for
            the first time in 1970, 71 years after the first
            German Grand Pix was staged at <i>Avus</i> near
            Berlin, a race for sports cars. The first World
            championship qualifying race was run at the notorious
            <i>Nurburgring</i> in 1951. Both recent venues,
            empirical in their grandeur, are long and fast and
            have had their fair share of tragedy. Think of the <i>&#145;ring&#146;</i>
            and you think of the death of <b>Phil Hill</b> and
            the dreadful accident of <b>Niki Lauda,</b> when he
            almost burned to death in the wreckage of his <b>Ferrari</b>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is said, that when
            drivers realised that the <i>Nurburgring</i> was too
            dangerous, <i>Hockenheim</i> was the only
            alternative, yet in 1968 when <b>Jim Clark </b>died
            at speed in a Formula 2 competition out in the lonely
            forests on the fast curling straight leading to the <i>Ostkurve,</i>
            chicanes were placed centrally on both fast straights
            effectively blunting the rhythm of the circuit. <b>Patrick
            Depailler </b>was fatally injured in 1980 at that
            corner, testing his <b>Alfa</b>, leading to another
            chicane being placed immediately before the fast
            right hander, destroying the quality of the only
            truly exciting corner that the track has. Two years
            later Frenchman <b>Didier Peroni </b>was badly
            injured in a collision with another car in a wet
            practice session. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Regarded as a
            &#145;meritless&#146; track, its use was intended to
            be a temporary stop gap to allow for the upgrading of
            the &#145;ring&#146;, but after <b>Lauda</b>&#146;s
            near tragedy in 1976, the race returned to <i>Hockenheim</i>
            and with the exception of the <i>European Grand Prix</i>
            in &#146;84 and the 1985 <i>German Grand Prix</i>, it
            has stayed there ever since. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Love it or
            hate it, they all race it&quot;.</i> <b>James Hunt</b>
            once said and, whilst it is an immensely daunting
            track, the drivers can certainly let their hair down
            and put their foot to the floor.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;It is
            scary,&quot;</i> says World Champion <b>Damon Hill</b>,
            <i>&quot;you sit there thinking, &#145;I hope the car
            doesn't do anything funny&#146;. There is a hell of a
            thrill from going along at 200 mph, coming into the
            chicane at high speed and braking really late. As
            impressive as the speed is in a Formula 1 car, more
            impressive is the braking. True, the circuit is a bit
            boring but there is something I like about hammering
            along through the trees.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One who will remember
            &#145;hammering through the trees&#146; last year and
            then exploding in white smoke, is <b>Gerhard Berger</b>,
            recently returned from a three race absence due to a
            sinus problem and doubly burdened by the recent death
            of his father in a plane crash. Berger led much of
            that race convincingly before being forced to retire
            with just two and a half laps to go handing the race
            to Hill and the runner up spot to his team mate <b>Jean
            Alesi</b>. No one remembers those &#145;almost
            men&#146;, the record books don&#146;t show the
            disappointment and the anger or the frustration of a
            weekend&#146;s labour to get the car to work
            impeccably for just 190 odd miles yet, even now, as
            Berger returns to the pits to announce his departure
            from Benetton at the end of the season, not many will
            remember that he won at Hockenheim for Ferrari in
            1994. It would seem that the longest running
            partnership in recent Formula 1 history is now
            breaking up. The Mercurial Frenchman and the wise yet
            mischievous Austrian, both having changed bosses at
            the same time after being bedfellows at Ferrari for
            three years prior to their disappointing two year
            tenure with <b>Flavio Briatore</b>&#146;s team.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;I have a few
            options, but will remain in Formula One only if I can
            drive for a top team.&quot; Berger said. &quot;It is
            a bad idea to make a decision when times are
            difficult.&quot;</i> The truth is, that his options
            are fewer than he thinks and the fact that the
            announcement was indeed made despite his suggestion
            as to opportune time in which to make decisions,
            leads one to conjecture if indeed it was Briatore
            giving him that gentle push. The Dinosaurs are going
            and the young predators are fighting their way to the
            lucrative watering holes of the top teams. With <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b> signed already and <b>Alex Wurz</b> in
            the blue corner waiting for the word it looks like
            Alesi to will be demoted from the front line also.
            All the movable old guard will get seats in the pit
            lane musical chairs but when everyone has finally sat
            down, the ones left standing will have nowhere to go
            but out or into the commentary boxes of the world.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ringmaster of the F1
            circus <b>Bernie Ecclestone</b> has publicly decried
            Hill&#146;s rumoured attempts at a $10 million fee
            for next year. A highly unlikely scenario seeing as
            his intention to move at all has yet to be announced.
            But it does illustrate the fact that with the single
            exception of <b>Michael Schumacher</b>, the <i>Tyrannosaurus
            Rex </i>himself, salaries will be a lot lower next
            year. The young <b><i>Veloce-raptors</i></b> are
            hungry for the spoils of the game and the elderly and
            infirm can move over.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Still, all is not doom
            and gloom at the Grand Prix. We can expect a battle
            royal between the newest veteran of the sport, <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b> and the number one German. This is a
            track that should suit not only the <b>Williams FW18</b>,
            but also the barely-seasoned Canadian who drives it
            and who craves &#145;fun&#146; in his racing. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">New additions to the
            Ferrari this weekend will make it a great deal more
            suitable to fast circuits, though no one will really
            have noticed a drop off in speed or handling of late,
            despite their first major mechanical failure this
            year, at Silverstone.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the total
            destruction of all four engines running at the
            British Grand Prix, <b>Martin Whitaker,</b> <b>Ford</b>
            director of European Motorsport regards the circuit
            on a more technical level and not surprisingly with
            some trepidation. <i>&quot;It&#146;s one of the
            hardest circuits on engines, with extended periods at
            full throttle during the lap,&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;It
            has a deserved reputation as an engine-breaker, so it
            is a particularly daunting task to go there after our
            experiences at Silverstone. But pushing the limits is
            the quickest way to move development forward.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Rubens Barrichello,
            Stewart</b> driver, seemed less pessimistic despite
            having to sit in front of one of the troublesome Ford
            power units this weekend. <i>&quot;The circuit is all
            about braking and your speed is in a straight line.
            While it's not a physically hard track, the drivers
            have to concentrate very hard on their braking
            points. It's an enjoyable feeling when you come out
            of those forests and meet the huge crowd in the
            Stadium section.&quot;</i> He added, <i>&quot;Two
            years ago I was fighting for a podium finish until I
            had to retire.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ready to impress and
            for sure they will, are the boys from <b>Jordan
            Peugeot.</b> Fisichella no doubt buoyed up by his
            rocketing credibility, will go well. With upgraded
            front and rear wing packages developed for the high
            speed circuits of <i>Monza</i> and <i>Hockenheim</i>,
            the cars will fly. Backed by renewed sponsorship from
            <i>BAT&#146;s Benson and Hedges</i> brand and fresh
            money coming in from <b>Lola</b>&#146;s former
            executioners, <i>MasterCard</i>, boss <b>Eddie Jordan</b>
            has to be one of the most satisfied men in the pits.
            His main card, young<b> Ralf Schumacher</b>
            marginally quicker than his Italian team mate but
            more erratic, is set to take Jordan to greater
            heights. The Irishman is also offering a seat for
            next year that everyone will want. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Technical Director <b>Gary
            Anderson</b> always first to offer his young guns
            sensible advice, said, <i>&quot;The teams advice to
            our drivers, will be to learn to come to terms with
            the low grip and 30% lower downforce levels which
            will make the car feel different. It will however
            feel nicer to drive as it slides more easily and the
            drivers can feel it.&quot;</i> Like a mother wrapping
            wolly scarves round her childrens&#146; necks and
            sending them off with packed lunches and clean
            hankies, Anderson continued, <i>&quot;We will tell
            them that they have to push for the top speeds but
            then remember that when they enter the corners they
            will take them at a much slower speed.&quot;</i> Of
            course they will Gary, but did you tell them to
            remember to brake?</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fastest in testing at
            Silverstone and Monza, a podium is a probability if
            the lads can keep their heads in gear, which brings
            us to the harassed Heinz Harald. Keeping his car in
            gear this time will be of prime importance as will
            avoiding other vehicles on the road. The pressure is
            now truly on him to perform and with only 19 points
            scored from nine races, his future is far from
            secure. Eviction from &#145;No1 pit lane&#146;,
            should not be ruled out.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;There is no
            doubt that driving for Williams moves you up a gear
            when it comes to pressure on the driver,&quot;</i> He
            said recently and, referring to his aborted start at
            Silverstone, <i>&quot;You don&#146;t get the same
            feel with a hand clutch that you do with a foot
            clutch. It never seems to bite in the same way.&quot;</i>
            The conjecture is of course that all the winter
            testing and between-race practice should have allowed
            him to overcome this particular problem by now.
            Another problem is his old adversary and fellow
            countryman Schumacher. Their rivalry goes back a long
            way to the F3 championships in 1989 where they fought
            a tremendous duel for the championship with <b>Karl
            Wendlinger,</b> who eventually won. Now for the first
            time since then, Frentzen can face Schumacher with
            equal machinery. <i>&quot;I hadn&#146;t raced against
            Michael in equal machinery since those Formula 3
            days.&quot;</i> He recalled. <i>&quot;Since then
            Michael has proved he is one of the best drivers in
            the world and he is a big challenge for
            anybody.&quot;</i> Indeed he is, especially for young
            Heinz-Harald. Having already lost out to the Ferrari
            driver when he not only took over his Girlfriend
            Corinna, but married her too, Frentzen is more than
            eager to engage in the near impossible task of
            proving himself on the track, as his equal.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In front of a home
            crowd Michael Schumacher should be unstoppable and
            despite his recent comments that, for him, <i>&quot;The
            real challenge for the championship should come next
            year,&quot;</i> the statistics prove him wrong.
            Currently leading both Constructors and drivers
            championships, Ferrari are improving at supersonic
            rates and should have Williams extremely worried.
            What was seen as a foregone conclusion at the
            beginning of the season is now at best for
            Frank&#146;s boys, a 50-50 chance. The challenge for
            Schumacher is <i>now</i>. Next year it could well be
            a walkover.</font></p>
