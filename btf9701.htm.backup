            Plato</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was one real
            star at the recent BTCC event - Jason Plato. No
            matter that he didn't manage to win - he shined by
            taking two pole positions and then racing well enough
            to take a second place in his first race. Alain
            Menu's touring car experience ultimately won over the
            exuberance of Plato, but the quality of that first
            showing suggests a BTCC star in the making. If you're
            into Formula One then you'll remember how last year
            Jaques Villeneuve started his first F1 race in
            similar style. Ultimately he didn't win the
            championship, but he came damned close.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course, having the
            best equipment helps. It helps a lot. It helps in
            Formula One, it helps in the IRL, and it helps in the
            BTCC. But getting there is a case of dealing with all
            those other hopefuls, the up and coming stars all of
            whom are probably within a tenth of a second of each
            other in a racing car. The world of motorsport is
            full of eager young men with something to prove. To
            reach the top you can't just be the best - you've got
            to be clever too. Clever enough to understand how the
            media works, clever enough to convince people that
            sponsorship is a good idea, clever enough to convince
            team owners that they've got something a little
            extra. Anyone who has followed Plato over the years
            will understand that - he's always excelled as a
            driver both in single seaters where his passion truly
            lies, and in cars like last year's Renault Spiders.
            But added to that he's always been an approachable
            and charming driver. Too often you find that racing
            drivers are far too busy to deal with riff-raff like
            the press&#133; and especially e-zines such as Speed.
            Jason Plato is different in that respect - every
            photographer and writer that you'll ever find at a
            racing circuit will only have nice things to say
            about the guy. Because of that he always gets some
            extra column inches. And because of that, people
            notice him more. In private he may be a complete
            bastard for all we know, but his public face is as
            impeccable as Damon Hill's.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While the front of the
            BTCC grid looks spookily similar to the F1 grid,
            things further behind are thankfully a bit more
            normal. Audi have slipped a little, and no surprise.
            Even if 4wd cars weren't to be outlawed from Super
            Touring, Audi were going to give up. Why? Because 4wd
            is too good for the rest of the field to deal with,
            so a huge weight handicap is imposed. The same
            applies to rear wheel drive cars like the BMWs,
            though their handicap is smaller. Basically you have
            to remember that this series is about entertainment
            and close racing&#133; if someone uses a given
            technology to give themselves an advantage then that
            technology will promptly be banned. This happens in
            most forms of motorsport - it's a long time since it
            was purely a measure of how fast a car could be made
            to travel. They'd be a <i>lot </i>faster now if that
            was the case!</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Honda looked good -
            with Gabrielle Tarquini throwing in the best
            performances by far. If Honda can motivate themselves
            into believing that a win is possible then they have
            the potential. They've often seemed like another
            Peugeot&#133; like they should be fighting at the
            front, yet never quite achieving. Peugeot, as usual,
            were languishing in mid-field - the car might look
            great, but although there's plenty of potential they
            suffered from all sorts of mechanical and electrical
            problems over the weekend. One day we might see
            Peugeot win a race, but I doubt if it'll be this
            season. It just doesn't seem possible. Sad, really.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ford seem to be slowly
            getting there with their Mondeos - but there's
            nothing to suggest a front runner just yet. But
            consistency looked good and there's a definite
            platform to build from. Consistency, on the other
            hand, was something sadly lacking from the Volvo pit.
            While they look like possible contenders this season,
            they managed a best position of second in the first
            race, and a ninth in the second for Kelvin Burt.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So who looks good for
            1997? Volvo, Renault, and Audi. The favourites have
            to be Renault, but which of their two drivers could
            take it I don&#146;t know. Menu's a damned fine racer
            - never one to make mistakes or jeopardise a good
            position, but his Renault partner, Jason Plato,
            showed incredible speed and ability on his first
            outing. Would anyone bet against these two battling
            it out over the course of the season? I doubt it.</font></p>
