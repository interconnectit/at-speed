            planned for Ferrari on Wednesday afternoon, but it
            was not completed due to strange rear-end vibrations
            which turned out to be a suspected gearbox problem.
            His best time on his second day, was 1m 25.44s. The
            car was closely examined in the pits and the team
            decided to postpone the scheduled run until Thursday.
            Schumacher covered a total of 33 laps, all of them in

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ralf Schumacher</b>
            in the Jordan-Peugeot, did a 1m 24.35s, spinning once
            on the exit of the first chicane which caused minor
            suspension damage. New body work developed after
            aerodynamic testing for the area around the front of
            the rear wheels, proved hugely successful and will
            run on the car for the<i> German Grand Prix.</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Composite manager <b>Tom
            Anderson</b> explained, <i>&quot;The new body work
            gives us aerodynamic performance gain which was shown
            by the wind tunnel and has now been confirmed by the
            Monza test. It will help the straight line speed of
            the car and it will now be current for all races and
            all circuits, making the old bodywork obsolete.&quot;</i>
            He continued, <i>&quot;The three piece body kit will
            enable mechanics to take away the centre section

            much of the day working on mechanical set up,
            concentrating in the afternoon on rear suspension
            geometry. A stuck throttle however gave him an
            unwelcome homecoming moment. <i>&quot;I was
            approaching the Roggia chicane, braking from 300kph
            when the throttle stayed open,&quot; </i>he said.<i>
            &quot;It was the scariest moment of my life as there
            is not enough run-off at that corner. Probably, I
            went on the clutch a bit too late and I was lucky to
            get the left front wheel on the grass. That made the
            car spin five or six times and I ended up at the exit
            of the chicane, the car pointing in the race

            season. <i>&quot;I'm a driver and I want to keep on

            In the afternoon he tackled the postponed race
            distance simulation. With the F 310 B (chassis 172)
            fitted with a new engine, He was still unable to
            complete the run. Having done 46 of the 53 laps that
            constitute an Italian Grand Prix distance, the engine
            began to lose power and the test was curtailed. His
            best lap time was 1m 24.958s. <i>&quot;I am
            unhappy,&quot;</i> said Michael. <i>&quot;If we
            cannot complete a full simulation, it means we have

            engine change. Muller completed 58 laps for a best of
            1m 25.73s during which he carried out the preliminary
            tests on the revised cooling system which employs two
            similar water radiators and a heat exchanger system
            for the engine oil. Preliminary evaluation suggests
            that it slight decreases the oil temperature but has
            an opposite effect on the water.</font></p>

            in Austria last week. He apparently became
            disorientated in foggy conditions and crashed the
            private plane into a hill shortly after taking off.

            boss <b>Flavio Briatore is rumoured to </b>have
            signed 24-year-old <b>Giancarlo Fisichella </b>to
            drive for the team in 1988. Current <b>Jordan Peugeot</b>
            driver, Fisichella, has been impressive in his first
            full year in Formula 1and it has long been suspected
            that Briatore, who also manages the Italian, would
            take up his option on the driver. It is expected that
            he will replace<b> Jean Alesi</b> who is rumoured to
            be in talks with the <b>Prost</b> team.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once again the uncanny
            knack of Team boss <b>Eddie Jordan </b>to spot rising
            talent has given others the opportunity to capitalise
            on their talents. Jordan was first to sign the likes
            of <b>Eddie Irvine</b>, <b>Jean Alesi</b> and <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b>. Speculation is rife that he may also
            lose <b>Ralf Schumacher</b> to <b>McLaren</b>
            possibly in an exchange deal that will fund a seat
            for <b>Damon Hill</b>.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jordan have finally
            confirmed what everyone has expected, that they have
            signed a deal with <b>Mugen-Honda</b> for an engine
            supply for the next two years. It is not expected
            that Honda will supply any other team. A delighted <b>Eddie
            Jordan</b> flew in from Japan on the eve of the <i>British
            Grand Prix</i> and announced the signing. He would
            not confirm that he had to use a Japanese driver as
            part of the package. With Fisichella expected to be
            on his way to Benetton at the end of the year, a
            place would exist, but with the current crop of
            average Oriental drivers available, it would negate
            the advantage of a quick engine.</font></p>

            deal going to Jordan, it now looks almost impossible
            for <b>Tom Walkinshaw</b>&#146;s <b>Arrows </b>team
            to secure a competitive engine for next year. <b>Mecachrome/Renault</b>,
            it seems, are content to let sleeping dogs lie and
            keep both Williams and Benetton supplied for the next
            couple of years at least, whilst <b>Peugeot</b>,
            never on the cards even as a customer engine, will go
            exclusively to the <b>Prost </b>team. <b>Ford</b>,
            contracted to <b>Stewart</b> and supplying <b>Tyrrell</b>
            with earlier evolution units, are not in the market
            to supply a second customer team. The under-funded <b>Hart
            </b>would need considerable development to get their
            V10 competitive <i>and</i> a large cash injection and
            would probably offer no greater benefit than the
            engine they currently use. With rumours of <b>Yamaha</b>
            quitting for a two year sabbatical to regroup and let
            the laughing die down, Walkinshaw has little choice
            but to go it alone with his own development engine.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Newly signed technical
            director <b>John Barnard</b> has apparently <i>&#145;known
            for at least six weeks&#146;</i> what engine they
            will be using next year. If it is to be Yamaha, it
            will continue to be prepared by <b>TWR</b> partners <b>Judd
            </b>and will not be badged with the team name.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Maybe Barnard could
            let <b>Damon Hill</b> in on the secret so that he can
            pack his bags early. Whatever options Walkinshaw has
            left, is not likely to appeal to Hill who needs a car
            to challenge for the championship again.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It seems the whole of
            the Formula 1 paddock is waiting to see where <b>Damon
            Hill</b> sits down in the annual game of musical
            chairs. His name so far has been linked with
            practically every team except <b>Arrows</b> and even
            old boss <b>Frank Williams</b>, seriously
            disappointed with the performance of <b>Heinz Harald
            Frentzen </b>this year, could actually admit to
            making a judgement error in signing the German and
            make amends by bringing back the Englishman. This
            would generate higher TV viewing figures with the
            prospect of Hill battling old adversary <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b> again. It is understood that <b>Renault
            </b>technical director <b>Bernard Dudot</b> said that
            <i>&#145;Williams would be leading the
            championship&#146; </i>by now if Hill had remained
            with the Grove based team.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both <b>Sauber</b> and
            <b>Prost</b> have expressed an interest in his
            services but it is now expected that <b>Jean Alesi</b>
            will take the seat at <b>Prost</b>, powered by <b>Peugeot
            </b>next year, alongside <b>Olivier Panis</b>.
            Sauber, whilst fairly reliable, has this year, been a
            disappointment and could not be considered by Hill,
            to be a car to win races despite its <b>Petronas</b>-badged<b>
            Ferrari </b>powerplant.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A move to <b>Benetton</b>
            now seems unlikely with the expected signing of
            Fisichella to replace Alesi and the likelihood of
            Berger a): retiring or b): moving on, would only
            motivate boss Briatore to employ the talents of far
            cheaper drivers such as<b> Jarno Trulli</b> or
            current hotshot and test driver <b>Alex Wurz</b>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>McLaren</b> has
            always been his best option. With <b>Mika Hakkinen</b>,
            despite recent fine performances, yet to score a
            victory for the team, it is likely that the Finn
            could find his way to <b>Sauber</b> leaving Hill to
            Join forces once again with <b>David Coulthard</b>,
            who last week hinted that it would be <i>&#145;great
            to have him as a team mate again.</i>&#145; The
            sticking point within McLaren however, is <b>Mercedes,</b>
            who are desperate for a German driver. This could be
            Frentzen if Williams do not take up their option on
            him for next year or, more likely, <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>.
            This would make <b>Eddie Jordan</b>&#146;s
            humiliation complete, being also expected to lose
            star protégée <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b> to <b>Benetton
            </b>next year. Hill could however, grab the
            German&#146;s seat at Jordan, as it is well known
            that Jordan was disappointed that he could not afford
            him last year. Hill will be aware of the fact that
            had he signed with the <i>Silverstone</i> based team,
            he could conceivably have been in contention for the
            Championship at this stage. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Apart from Williams,
            the latter two teams seem to be the only options
            worth considering and it would be a wise team boss to
            make the offer before Walkinshaw has another go at
            holding on to him for another inglorious year.</font></p>
