        Q RAC Rally Championship</strong></font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Rally
        enthusiasts all around the world</strong> will already
        know the significance of the Network Q RAC Rally. For
        those who do not, this is the final challenge for the
        drivers and manufacturers competing to win the World
        Rally Championship.<br>
        The RAC Rally consists of 300 miles of top class racing
        action spread over twenty-eight stages around the United
        Kingdom, and without doubt this isthe most comprehensive
        rally simulation available to the public. <br>
        It features six high performance cars, extensive scenery,
        variable weather conditions, variable track surfaces and
        much, much more examined in detail below.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong>Installation</strong></em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Rally
        Championship offers three levels of installation</strong>:
        2Mb, 50Mb and 90Mb, and may be installed (and played)
        under DOS or in a full-screen Windows 95 DOS session. <br>
        Installation was simple and flawless, as was the
        automatic configuration of the sound card. However, it is
        worth noting that only the full installation appears to allow
        in-car music, despite the CD &quot;readme&quot; file
        which indicates that only the minimum installation
        disallows in-car music. Despite the confusion, the music
        is of high quality and is well worth pursuing. <br>
        Once the game is started, the player is presented with an
        attractive introductory sequence displaying various film
        clips of rally cars demonstrating their awesome potential.
        Immediately it becomes obvious that the player will
        receive an unique experience with this game - any road
        racing driving techniques may as well be left behind in
        the paddock!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong>The
        Interface</strong></em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong><img
        src="Rac-002.gif" align="left" hspace="0" width="280"
        height="210"></strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The
        game interface is a simple and functional front end</strong>
        to the driving mode. It is presented as nested layers of icons
        offering various options for the player to choose from. Surprisingly,
        there is no mouse support, and so navigation of the icon
        boxes requires use of the keyboard or joystick.<br>
        The various options include settings for damage, weather, automatic
        brakes, viewpoints, sizes and resolutions, opponent intelligence
        etc. Some of the options, for example the weather, are
        only in effect during the game's arcade mode - the player
        can sensibly not change such attributes during a
        championship season. In addition to the championship and
        5 levels of arcade, additional racing modes include
        &quot;individual&quot; and &quot;time-trial&quot;. Arcade
        is against the clock with opponents and checkpoints;
        Individual is racing a single stage (user selectable)
        with opponents; Time-trial is the player competing for
        the best times in the record books, and Championship is
        the full and perhaps daunting twenty-eight stage
        super-challenge.<br>
        Also available from the front end is a brief history and
        resume of the Rally and also details about the cars the
        player can drive. The briefing is given by none other
        than TV presenter and former co-driver Tony Mason, who
        also features as co-driver in the game - more on that
        later.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong>Car
        Selection</strong></em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The
        player has access to a variety of cars</strong> ranging
        in horse power featuring 4WD, FWD and RWD drive-trains.
        They are: the Subaru Impreza Turbo, the Ford Escort
        Cosworth 4x4, the Renault Maxi Megane, the Proton Wire,
        the VW Golf GTi 16 Valve, and finally the 155BHP Skoda
        Felicia.<br>
        Each of the cars behave differently as they certainly
        should, and it becomes necessary for the player to
        consider this when deciding upon a race strategy. For
        example, whilst competing inside an overall score table
        against the computer opponents, it is perhaps more
        important that the player concentrates on performing well
        against the other drivers within his or her class.<img

        height="210"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong>The
        Championship</strong></em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>First
        off, the player is presented with the Leg information </strong>screen.
        This includes the initial stage number, its location, its
        start and stop time (day/night), the length of the stage,
        weather and track surface information and a map. Using
        the arrow keys, the player can view each stage of the leg
        up until the next available service point. It is vital to
        plan your race, setting-up the car appropriately for the
        stages ahead. <br>
        The characteristics of the car you may modify depend upon
        the vehicle, but for the majority you can change:
        suspension height and stiffness, brake balance, steering
        response, the gear ratios and tyre choice. Each of these
        parameters will be a factor in your success or failure
        (note that the options screen has an automatic setting,
        and of course you can always accept the defaults). Whilst you
        might be tempted to ignore this screen, for obvious
        reasons you should at least select the correct tyre
        compound for the stage ahead: you can choose between a
        variety ranging from tarmac slicks, through to mud, snow
        and rain tyres (the stage planning screen gives a
        run-down on surface percentages of tarmac, gravel, mud
        and snow).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong>Together
        we`ll fly!</strong></em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Into
        the car and the count-down is given</strong>. Wait for
        the GO or do what I did: incur a 1 minute time penalty
        straight away for jumping the start! Floor the accelerator
        and we're off. Suddenly, good ol' Tony Mason is
        screaming, &quot;HAIRPIN LEFT!&quot; Oooh, on the
        braaaaaaaaaaaaaakes, crunch... ah ha!<br>
        So the first bend wasn't entirely successful, but never
        mind! Then, a quick succession of &quot;easy right, easy
        left, medium right&quot; is heard. Wow, my PC speakers
        are telling me something useful in a driving game - good
        stuff, and Tony does an excellent job at it, too. He
        warns the player of turns, jumps, water, and in the tight
        twisty sections, the player really has to remember
        exactly the instructions that have been given because
        events occur so quickly, the co-driver has to rattle them
        off in advance. Easy you think? Yeah ok... now try doing
        it in a night stage on a narrow forest gravel track!<br>
        <img src="Rac-005.gif" align="left" hspace="0"
        width="320" height="240"></font><font size="2"
        face="Arial">Still in control? Ok, picture this: it's a
        night stage and you're driving an Escort Cosworth 4x4,
        the headlights point the way, but they're not particularly
        effective because it's hammering down with rain. The windscreen
        wipers are thumping back and forth, and visibility
        overall is pretty horrendous. You're powering your way
        out of a medium right turn, the back end hanging out, hundreds
        of loose gravel chips thrown up by each of the wheels.
        Mason calls out, &quot;easy right&quot;, and somewhere in
        the dark, a group of intrepid, rain sodden spectators
        flash by as they stand out at the side of the track.
        Mason calls out more instructions but by now the rain is
        falling even harder and you can hardly see a thing - it's
        virtually impossible to see the road ahead. &quot;HAIRPIN
        RIGHT!!!&quot; You're looking out for the turn, but you
        must brake before you see it, so anticipation and
        insanity is required, and suddenly the heavens groan and
        a crash of thunder rapidly followed by several seconds of sheet
        lightning blind your way. Of course now you're hard on
        the brakes, but still you can't see anything, but finally
        the lightning fades... where is the turn, where is the
        turn? And if you haven't hit anything, you're ok. If you
        have, you know it is essential that your car lasts
        several more stages of the leg before a service is possible...
        what damage has been done? And is it terminal?<br>
        By this stage of the review, I hope you appreciate that
        Rally Championshipis a considerably detailed game. It
        features a great deal of audio, from the rain, wipers and
        the gear clunk to what sounds like a turbo/dump valve
        effect on the Cosworth. Each of the track surfaces has a
        different sound effect, and there's a nice round of
        applause when the car finally reaches the finishing post. <br>
        The graphics are very nicely rendered indeed - each of
        the stages mapped out with stunning track-side scenery.
        The horizon graphics are detailed with spectators, bushes
        and rocks populating the edges of the tracks, and one aspect
        that impressed me in particular were the transitions from
        one road surface to another. For example, near the end of
        a gravel section, tiny sections of tarmac would start to
        become apparent between the gravel, and the sounds from
        the tyres would also reflect the changing environment.
        Neat!<br>
        The twenty-eight rounds of the championship are basically
        structured into four legs, with a number of stages and
        servicing/repair points within each leg. <br>
        Once proficient at the game, the player will appreciate
        that during a long stage (sometimes taking up to around
        25 minutes), it is essential to take great care of the
        car and not to throw it into the barriers at every
        opportunity. This is because damage is carried across
        stages and may only be repaired when a service point is
        reached. Typically, the available time for repairs will
        be between 15 and 45 minutes, and each section of the car
        that has acquired damage, and/or general wear and tear,
        will be assessed and assigned a repair time. The player
        will then make decisions on what are the highest priority
        components to fix before driving the upcoming stages. For
        example, there would be no point wasting time fixing headlamps
        and wipers for a day time stage in sunny weather; fixing
        the engine, exhaust or clutch, for example, would be far
        more strategically beneficial.</font><img

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong>So
        what`s up?</strong></em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Overall,
        Rally Championship is good</strong> honest attempt at
        what is a difficult sport to simulate to a high standard.
        There are a few aspects of the game that I feel could be
        improved: for example, the presence of what I would describe
        as invisible barriers alongside the track is frustrating
        and somewhat disappointing - the ability to slap the car
        into a ditch or through a fence and into a lake would
        certainly moderate the driving style of the player!<br>
        Ok, a word about the driving physics. Generally not bad -
        it's fun to brake and slide the car through the medium
        bends and catch it as the accelerator is floored on the
        drive out of the turns. The physics models are affected
        by road camber and gradients (for example, put the car in
        neutral and it will slowly accelerate down a hill) which
        is all very encouraging, but on the negative side (and
        this really depends on how much emphasis you place on
        having a realistic physics model), when the car is thrown
        into the air, it seems to maintain suspiciously static
        roll and pitch angles. I would also have enjoyed the
        facility of a hand-brake, the effect of locking the
        wheels under braking, and to experience severe understeer
        out from a turn as a FWD car struggles for grip under
        rapid acceleration, particularly when driving in rain and
        snow. One other point is that traction appears to be
        calculated all-round rather than by each individual tyre contact
        patch. For example, placing the left side of the car on
        the grass and the right side of the car on tarmac and
        slamming on the brakes results in a perfectly straight
        pull-up. This is clearly an inadequacy of the driving
        model and if improved, would have made an incredible
        rally experience as each tyre experienced differing
        levels of grip. <br>
        But, the game is extremely enjoyable and a most worthy
        addition to any gamer's collection. And an added bonus as
        that the game also supports link-up and an eight player
        IPX mode! Good fun and well recommended.<img
