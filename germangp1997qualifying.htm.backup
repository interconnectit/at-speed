            size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Everybody knows the
            difficult times I have had in the past weeks and the
            only way to sort it out was to do a quick lap and
            that&#146;s what I did today.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So said a 37 year old <b>Gerhard
            Berger,</b> the man who rode rough-shod over the
            opposition and then went back and did it again. His
            statement reveals undertones of the casualness of a
            true veteran and the sincerity of a man finding
            himself at the inevitable cross-roads of his career.
            Standing down to be replaced by the young driver <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b>, it is ironic that the two strongest
            performances of the day were by the very same duo and
            the <i>&#145;Old Dog&#146;</i>, driving his first
            qualifying session for over two months due to a sinus
            infection, showed the young whippersnapper his back
            side.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Being Austrian is the
            next best thing to being German but this did not
            specially please the crowd who, baying and rippling
            in a sea of &#145;Mexican waves&#146;, blared their
            klaxons at anything red or yellow. The noise of the
            crowd erupting at the mere oscillation of the
            red-gloved wrist of their idol, <b>Michael
            Schumacher,</b> drowned the air compressors and the
            shrill revs of the engines being started for the
            qualifying session.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Early out and first to
            hang on to provisional pole, was <b>Mika Hakkinen</b>&#146;s
            <b>McLaren</b> setting the yard stick of 1.42.5 and
            proving the strength of the <b>Mercedes</b> engine.
            The Jordan boys of <b>Ralf Schumacher</b> and
            Fisichella were mixing it well and slotted behind in
            2nd and 3rd but for the briefest of moments when
            older brother, Michael, driving for all he was worth
            in a <b>Ferrari</b> that looked decidedly ragged and
            off the pace, snatched the Italian&#146;s 3rd slot.
            This would rise to 2nd place before Fisichella&#146;s
            <b>Peugeot</b> powered <b>Jordan</b> re-took and kept
            his slot on the front row of the grid. <i>&quot;I am
            reasonably happy with fourth place, which is what I
            had expected.&quot; </i>Said Schumacher and this time
            the underplaying of his comments was absent. <i>&quot;We
            went better in qualifying than we did in the morning
            session. My closest rival, Villeneuve is only ninth
            and that is very important. As for any prediction
            about tomorrow, this time I would rather not make
            any.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He did indeed trounce <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b> by over eight tenths of a second which
            is considerably better than of late, both <b>William&#146;s</b>
            suffering from bad understeer and leaving the team in
            a quandary as to how to rectify the problem. Despite
            valiant efforts from both drivers, the car just did
            not have the legs and left the Canadian trailing in
            9th position with his team-mate Frentzen, for once
            looking a little more confident but still only on the
            third row. <i>&quot;We just didn&#146;t have the
            speed and I was pushing all the time.&quot;</i> Said
            Villeneuve. Having had to use the spare car for the
            tail end of the session, he commented, <i>&quot;In
            the race car with the same downforce levels as Heinz
            I was quite a bit slower down the straight&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>David Coulthard</b>
            could not match team mate Hakkinen&#146;s pace and
            was hard pushed to stay ahead of the lower ranks but
            ironically and no doubt of scant comfort to him, he
            ended a slot up on the Williams of Villeneuve, in
            8th. <i>&quot;I struggled a bit with nervousness at
            the rear of the car on entries (to corners) and
            because of that I had a spin on the 2nd to last
            corner.&quot; </i>He said.<i> &quot;It doesn&#146;t
            bode well for the race other than to hope that our
            reliability will let us score some points.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The last few minutes
            produced the usual rush of aspirants to pole but none
            amounted to a hill of beans beside Berger&#146;s
            efforts. He was out on several occasions giving the
            car everything until there was nothing left to give
            spinning the car on his last lap seconds before the
            session ended.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For a circuit that
            most definitely did not suit the <b>Arrows</b> of <b>Damon
            Hill </b>his time of 1.43.36 gave him 13th position,
            1 ahead of <b>Sauber</b>&#146;s <b>Johnny Herbert </b>and
            1 behind <b>Rubens Barichello</b>. Saying that he was
            &#145;satisfied&#146; rather than pleased with his
            result, he too could not help feeling the <i>&#145;Berger
            factor&#146; </i>saying with some relief, <i>&quot;He&#146;s
            still got it and it&#146;s good to see, because
            he&#146;s older than me!&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The<b> Benetton</b>
            team of Flavio Briatore, is the strongest looking
            team at Hockenheim having not only got the pole, but
            the high ground in morale, having possibly secured
            the driver of the season. All team boss <b>Eddy
            Jordan</b> would say about the loss of his boy
            Fisichella to the Italian team next year, was that <i>&quot;Negotiations
            were still continuing and nothing is settled.&quot;</i>
            Obviously pleased about Ginacarlo&#146;s progress he
            said, &quot;<i>It&#146;s a great feeling to know that
            we will be starting from the front row but ultimately
            however, it is the race result which counts, so we
            must put the great feeling of today aside and
            concentrate on what we have to do tomorrow. We really
            need to get that win.&quot;</i> He added without a
            hint of humour, <i>&quot;Once we win one we can win a
            lot.&quot;</i> Few who could face his steely glint,
            would disagree.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The whole weekend
            somehow has been about old men running out of puff
            and the new breed taking over Ecclestone&#146;s
            asylum. The Home crowd failed to get their main man,
            or his brother, on the front row, but has witnessed
            the ascension of a couple of stars to the Formula 1
            firmament. Whether they can hold it together for the
            race or be trampled by the stampeding Buffalo of the
            old guard remains to be seen. Michael will most
            probably have a fight on his hands and not from the
            blue and white quarter as one may expect but whether
            the yellow snake will be hissing at his wheels, or he
            will be chasing it&#146;s tail , the crowd will have
            something to cheer about over their Bratwurst and
            beers.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last year Berger led
            the race until the last lap when his engine expired.
            To get into that position for tomorrow&#146;s race,
            would have been lucky up until today, but now he
            could be on to a very fine swan song indeed.</font></p>
