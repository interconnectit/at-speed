            &#145;stop go&#146; penalty at the <i>Austrian Grand
            Prix</i>. A place on the podium was his for the
            taking had he not inadvertently passed <strong>Heinz
            Harald Frentzen</strong> under the yellow caution
            flag. The Germans will all be there shouting and
            cheering him on, camping out in the woods that
            surround the Northern end of the circuit. Many will
            realise how close they are to history with the old
            circuit hidden in the dense <em>Adenau forest,</em>
            now just a host to the boy racers and tourists who
            come throughout the year to drive <em>&#145;The
            Nordschleife&#146;</em>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <em>Nurburgring</em>
            probably ranks as the greatest track ever built,
            monumental in it&#146;s spectacle and awesome in
            it&#146;s challenge. Originally a 14.2 mile loop that
            plunged and soared, twisted and turned through dense
            forest hedges and trees. Cars would breast the rise
            at the <i>Flugplatz</i> and leave the ground for 50
            yards before landing hard and tearing down hill to<i>
            Fuchsr</i></font><font size="1" face="Arial"><i>Ö</i></font><font

            bottoming out before the sharp incline to <i>Adenauer
            Forst</i> to continue the switch back ride for mile
            after mile culminating in a mile and a half straight
            leading to the start finish line.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Built in 1925 to
            provide work in the depressed area around Cologne,
            the first German GP took place there the following
            year. The authorities however, were aware of the
            dangers it presented and after the deaths of so many
            drivers including <i>Herbie Muller</i>, <i>John
            Taylor</i>, <i>Ernst Von Delius</i> and <i>Gerhard
            Mitter</i> the circuit was remodelled in 1970 and
            thought by many to be ruined but it still provided
            spectacle and excitement and was no less dangerous.
            The culmination of these renewed fears was Niki
            Lauda&#146;s near fatal accident when he was badly
            burned in his Ferrari. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once off the Formula 1
            calendar the old circuit went into decline. Used
            occasionally until 1983 by Formula 2 and World
            Sportscar Championship rounds, it&#146;s reputation
            however, never dwindled and it has become a circuit
            of legend and <i>derring do</i>. The great races are
            numerous. <i>Nuvolari </i>beating the might of the <i>Auto
            Unions</i> and the <i>Mercedes</i>&#146; in his
            outdated Alfa Romeo in 1935. In 1938 a year before
            the outbreak of war, young Englishman <i>Dick Seaman</i>
            won the first Grand Prix for a Nazi sponsored <b>Mercedes
            Benz</b> and in 1968 Jackie Stewart won in the gloom
            and wet by over 4 minutes. But while the supercharged
            ghosts of the great Marques still echoed in the
            valley, construction started on a newer, shorter and
            &#145;safer&#146; circuit alongside the old
            &#145;Ring&#146; road circuit. Greeted with contempt
            originally, as was the recent emasculation of the <i>Osterreichring,</i>
            it played host to it first Grand Prix in 1984. Called
            the European Grand Prix, as <i>Hockenheim</i> was in
            favour for the national race, it was won by <b>Alan
            Prost</b> in what was regarded as a rather dull
            affair and the following year it staged the German
            race, <b>Michele Alboreto</b> taking his last win for
            </font><a
            href="http://www.at-speed.co.uk/smn/fe97sp.htm"><font
            size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ferrari</b>. </font></a></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Grand Prix
            reverted to <i>Hockenheim</i> for the next ten years
            but with the need for further European fixtures and a
            lack of tracks deemed suitable by the FIA the new
            2.83 mile Nurburgring with it huge run off areas and
            &#145;friendly&#146; corners was the ideal solution.
            It&#146;s 12 corners provide little challenge or
            opportunity for drivers to extend themselves and the
            only fast part of the circuit that runs close to the
            old track, is slowed by the <em>Veedol Schikane</em>.
            Taken by some as a sad reflection of the modern
            racing era, it is, like the A1-Ring, now more
            eminently suitable to today&#146;s breed of cars than
            it was 10 years ago and with next year bringing in
            further instabilities to check speed and increase
            spectator enjoyment.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It did however provide
            an interesting race last year again in the guise of
            the European Grand Prix when it became the first
            victory for <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b> in his rookie
            year as no 2 to current Champion <b>Damon Hill</b>.</font></p>
            <p><a href="http://www.at-speed.co.uk/smn/fe97sp.htm"><font
            size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Ferrari </strong></font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial">can be expected to mount a huge
            effort to claw back the points lost in Austria and
            regain their performance advantage that they enjoyed
            mid-season. Williams are seemingly back in contention
            after a non competitive interlude for both team and
            driver and have managed to regain their hold on the
            constructors championship with a 12 point advantage.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The task of Williams
            and Ferrari is now even greater with the increased
            competitiveness of the rest of the grid, notably
            Jordan and </font><a
            href="http://www.at-speed.co.uk/smn/ml97sp.htm"><font
            size="2" face="Arial"><strong>McLaren</strong></font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial">. Little more than two seconds
            covered the starting grid in Austria and the smallest
            mistake can be catastrophic.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The battle for tyre
            supremacy is also affecting the grid with more of the
            mid-field runners using the extremely effective
            Bridgestones appearing higher up the grid than ever
            before. It only needs a few top teams to switch
            loyalties from Goodyear to the Japanese company and <b>Bridgestone</b>
            could easily become a commanding and indispensable
            force in team strategy.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The level of racing
            will be high this weekend and whilst the circuit may
            lack the heroic proportions of it&#146;s mother this
            bastard offspring could throw up a few surprises. Its
            not all cut and dried for the Ferrari or Williams.
