        <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
            face="Arial"><img src="autoyo1.jpg" align="left"
            hspace="0" width="200" height="246"></font><font
            color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The first thing
            that always hits me when I attend these types of show
            is the distance between the car park and the action.
            But then I'm a fundamentally lazy person. Having to
            walk anywhere is against my basic nature.
            Fortunately, on the public days there should be
            shuttle buses to get from the more remote car parks
            to the entrance hall of the imposing National Exhibition
            Centre.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
            face="Arial">Once through the usual queuing and
            orientation with the maps has taken place you'll find
            yourself with literally hundreds of stalls and
            displays to explore. Some are obviously big money
            enterprises whilst others are simpler, more homely
            affairs. There's certainly no lack of choice, though
            it's quite obvious that there are plenty of smaller motorsports
            companies who simply won't have been able to afford
            the £2,000 minimum charge for even the smallest of spaces.
            Companies like... well, companies like ourselves, where
            £2,000 would take a huge chunk out of our annual budget.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
            face="Arial"><img src="aump01.jpg" align="left"
            hspace="4" vspace="4" width="200" height="132"></font><font
            color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">However, in the
            world of multi-million pound PR budgets the cost of
            the space is minimal. Instead the money is concentrated
            on paying for drivers like Martin Brundle and John Watson
            to go head to head on the Microprose stand race
            simulators, or the money goes on the tidy corporate
            hospitality suites built into the big two floor
            displays that probably cost tens of thousands to build.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
            face="Arial">Catering on the day is the usual
            combination of expensive and none too tasty, but it
            fills a hungy hole when you've been wandering through
            stall after stall for what seems like miles. Food is
            available for most tastest, but if your requirements
            are strictly vegetarian, Kosher, or Hallal then don't
            expect much in the way of choice. There's certainly a wide
            range of cafés and restaurants to make sure that wherever
            you are you should never feel hungry.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
            face="Arial">Some of the stands are fantastic if
            you're a complete racing anorak! A show like this is
            really about the cars and technology. So if you want
            to see what an F1 brake system looks like close up
            then go and visit the Brembo stand. If clutches do it
            for you then nip over and say hello to the boys at
            AP. Heck, there's even an Autojumble for classic car owners
            to root through, though as ever I failed to find a single
            part for my ancient Alfa!</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
            face="Arial">If your interest lies more in the
            personalities behind the wheels then apart from a few
            notable exceptions you'll be out of luck. Although
            you can see which drivers are in attendance by
            looking in our '</font><a href="au1997ts.htm"><font
            color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">stars</font></a><font
            color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">' section. If
            you want to meet the drivers in many of the British
            race championships then simply turn up at almost any
            event and ask. You'll be surprised how approachable
            almost anybody outside the F1 and BTCC circuses can
            be. Watch out for the <em>Speed </em>race calendar
            which is due out on our official launch late in February
            1997.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
            face="Arial">Another event incorporated into the show
            which is new this year is the Autosport Engineering
            show. This is only available on the Thursday and
            Friday. Access is restricted for the general public,
            but almost everyone in the motorsport industry should
            be able to get in to that area.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
            face="Arial">So would we recommend you go to the
            show? Well, you're reading this review... so you're
            probably keen on motorsport... so yes, go there, and
            prepare for a great day. Just remember to arrive
            early to make sure you have time to see everything
            there is.</font></p>
