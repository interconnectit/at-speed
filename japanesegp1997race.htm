            size="2" face="Arial"> of <b>Mika Hakinnen</b> fell
            in behind with a close following Irvine ready to
            pounce. <i>&quot;Jacque&#146;s plan was to hold
            everyone up and to make life difficult, especially
            for me.&quot;</i> Said a happy but slightly
            disgruntled Schumacher later. <i>&quot;He probably
            knows that he doesn&#146;t score any points from this
            race, so he wanted me to lose as many points as
            possible which meant slowing me down and getting some
            cars in front of me. It didn&#146;t work, as Eddie
            told me he (Irvine) might try and pass me at that
            point and it was quite funny when it happened. It was
            a very good manoeuvre.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">That manoeuvre was a
            key point to Schumacher&#146;s victory. A stunning
            pass by the Ulsterman at turn 2 on the 2nd lap
            enabled him to pass both Hakkinen and his team mate.
            His express train then went on to pass the leading
            car of Villeneuve a lap later and streak away to set
            a string of fastest laps over 2 seconds quicker than
            Villeneuve, who was doing his level best to slow
            things down to allow the field to bunch behind
            Schumacher. <i>&quot;We had an idea that Jacques was
            going to hold everybody up and we had a few ideas
            about how to get past him and it went pretty much to
            plan.&quot; </i>Irvine said.<i> &quot;The opportunity
            to pass presented itself and although Jacques tried
            to block me, I went round the outside of him. I
            started pulling away and I was just waiting for the
            phone call!&quot; </i>By the end of lap 6 Irvine was
            12 seconds clear and Ferrari&#146;s strategy seemed
            to be working like a dream.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Irvine was the first
            of the front runners to stop on lap17, handing the
            lead to Villeneuve and rejoining to take up a
            rearguard position behind Frentzen in 4th. With
            Schumacher pitting a lap later and the</font><a

            size="2" face="Arial"> duo two laps later, Irvine
            found himself back at the front with a positive lead
            over his team mate. Villeneuve chased hard and almost
            came to blows with the Ferrari at the pit lane exit
            when he roared into Schumacher&#146;s path in a
            desperate attempt to regain the initiative. <i>&quot;Jacques
            came out of the pits and tried to close the door and
            I&#146;m not too sure that it was the correct thing
            to do, to move over the circuit and try to push
            someone.&quot;</i> Said Schumacher. <i>&quot;I
            corrected my situation and took him on the inside,
            but it could have been dangerous.&quot; </i>With new
            tyres he was able to stay close to the rear of
            Schumacher&#146;s Ferrari but was unable to catch and
            pass it. To Villeneuve, it meant little. <i>&quot;My
            only objective was to try and slow him and I was
            surprised that nobody tried to overtake him.&quot;</i>
            He said. <i>&quot;Then we lost the battle in the pit
            stops. We came out a little ahead of him but he was
            on the track and his momentum carried him past
            me.&quot;</i></font></p>

            size="2" face="Arial"> master-plan was being unrolled
            and the baton was ready to be passed to the man
            behind. On lap 23, Irvine got his phone call via the
            pits to car radio and slowed sufficiently to allow
            Schumacher by in a precision move that placed him as
            the filling to a rather dangerous sandwich, keeping
            the frustrated Canadian at bay.<i> &quot;When Michael
            got past Villeneuve at the pit exit it was obvious
            that I was going to have to slow down and try to give
            Michael a bit of a gap.&quot;</i> Irvine said.<i>
            &quot;then I was told to let Michael through and try
            and slow Villeneuve. We had a plan as to where we
            would do it and where it would give us the least
            risk.&quot;</i> The plan worked, as Schumacher
            started to pull clear, with Irvine keeping a watching
            brief in his rear mirrors to ensure that the Williams
            stayed put. It must have angered Villeneuve that
            Irvine was doing everything that his own team mate
            Frentzen was failing to do. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Frentzen was having
            his own problems finding it hard to stay in touch
            with the leaders and remained behind Hakinnen who,
            despite having a three stop strategy was running yet
            another competitive race. <i>&quot;I ran very little
            downforce trying to be quick on the straights and I
            had a bit of understeer right from the start.&quot;</i>
            Frentzen said later. <i>&quot;I had a lot of fuel on
            board and it was quite difficult to keep up with the
            other guys. my target was just to keep going.&quot;</i>
            However, by staying in contention at the end of the
            leading gaggle of cars, he was able to take over at
            the front, if only temporarily, when teams started
            pulling their drivers in again, for fuel and tyres.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The 2nd Ferrari stops
            on laps 33 and 34, saw Schumacher and Irvine rejoin
            behind the new leader Frentzen who had yet to stop
            for a second time. A sticking fuel nozzle turned what
            should have been a routine stop of around 7 seconds
            into a 13.4 second time-warp for a demoralised
            Villeneuve who could do nothing but shake his head
            sadly as he saw a lousy situation turn even worse. He
            was now out of contention for the top honours, Irvine
            having done an excellent job of disrupting the </font><a

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The only Hiccup to
            Ferrari&#146;s plans occurred when Frentzen rejoined
            the circuit in front of Irvine who had fallen right
            off the pace and was now fighting to hold on to third
            from the </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial"> of <b>Mika Hakinnen</b>. <i>&quot;He
            moved over onto the racing line, which you should not
            do when you came out of the pits.&quot; </i>Explained
            Irvine. &quot;<i>The car understeered badly on the
            last set of tyres and I was locking the front brakes
            as well. I was losing front end grip and I was going
            further and further back on the brake balance.
            Hakinnen was always going to be quicker so I just had
            to drive whereby I was quicker in the important
            parts.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With Villeneuve even
            further down the field in 7th it was Frentzen&#146;s
            turn to step in for the Williams team and ensure that
            they secured their eighth <i>Constructors
            Championship</i>. The fastest lap of the race was his
            and at 1.38.942 was only 3 hundredths of a second
            slower than Villeneuve&#146;s pole position for the
            &#146;96 Grand Prix. Proof indeed that, as the rules
            make the cars slower, the designers make them go
            faster.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher passed the
            chequered flag a mere second or so in front of
            Frentzen, a lead decimated by outgoing World Champion
            <b>Damon Hill</b>&#146;s uncharacteristic reluctance
            to let himself be passed by the faster car on the
            penultimate lap. <i>&quot;Hill made life very
            difficult for me.&quot; </i>Said Schumacher.<i>
            &quot;There were a lot of blue flags and he should
            have let me through.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuve finished a
            miserable 5th with his two points expected to be
            taken away from him when the FIA court of appeal
            meets in Paris next week to examine his appeal

            car was going reasonably, except for a slight
            understeer. I got stuck behind Villeneuve and,

            him.&quot; </i>Team mate <b>Gerhard Berger</b> came
            in 9th having had to make a further unscheduled stop.
            <i>&quot;This was a frustrating race. I made the
            wrong choice of tyres and had to go for a three-stop
            strategy.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;But even that
            did not help as I did not manage to get a good
            performance out of the tyres and I was left behind.

            size="2" face="Arial">technical director <b>Pierre
            Fauconnier,</b> summed up the teams feeling when he
            said, <i>&quot;The fact that the drivers started from
            9th and 12th on the grid, together with the
            reliability of the cars in front, means the final
            result was no surprise. It was, however a
            disappointment, since it is so removed from the
            excellent performances demonstrated in the second
            half of the season.&quot;</i> Again <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella </b>finished higher than co- driver <b>Ralf
            Schumacher</b> in 8th. Young Ralf said, <i>&quot;I
            was lucky not to spin at the end of the race as there
            was some oil on the circuit.&quot;</i> Strange that
            no one else seemed to spot it.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">An audible <i>&#145;Whoop!&#146;</i>
            came from a jubilant and much relieved Schumacher as,
            cheered by an equally ecstatic Ferrari pit crew, he
            hugged team mate Irvine before the ritual Champagne
            shower. Paying a well deserved tribute to his partner
            and also scotching any silly rumours that Berger
            would replace him next season, he said, <i>&quot;It
            is thanks to him that I have this victory. I have
            always said he is a great driver and a great
            team-mate.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher&#146;s win
            takes the race to the line in <i>Jerez </i>in a
            fortnight. Villeneuve&#146;s lead is now down to a
            single point and should these be taken away from him
            as it is commonly expected, the German will have a
            one point lead in Spain and the psychological
            advantage. With the Constructors championship nicely
            wrapped up by Williams, the driver&#146;s crown has
            still to find a fitting head. Spain will be the
            decider, the fickle finger of Formula 1 fate having
            seen fit to deal the cards to make it so. Fortunes
            have swung dramatically both ways in the past three
            races and as the barometer starts it&#146;s downward
            path for Villeneuve, he will be thinking that nothing
            really has changed. He is still leading the
            championship and even if they level the score in
            Jerez he will have won by dint of the number of
            outright wins on his scorecard. The <b>FIA</b>
            however could play the most important role in this
            end of season drama.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unsympathetic as they
            always seem to be with appeals, regarding them as
            mere delaying tactics, the <b>FIA</b> are wont to
            increase the penalty if the appeal is not upheld. The
            impetuous Villeneuve has had his run-ins with the
            governing body in the past, having criticised to the
            point of lude swearing, both the merits of next years
            cars and Mosley himself. He has been let off twice
            before for racing under a yellow flag and this
            disqualification is a result of infringing the rules
            whilst under a suspended ban for the same offence at <i>Monza</i>.
            There is therefore the possibility of the <b>FIA</b>
            banning Villeneuve from the final race also and
            handing the Championship on a silver platter, to
            Schumacher. No one, least of all the twice world
            champion, would want this and the FIA should realise
            that to do this would deprive the sport of one of the
            most exciting title defences for a long time. They
            should also be aware of the revenue they will lose as
            TV viewers world-wide switch off and crowds fail to
            show in Spain.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Again it all came down
            Villeneuve, <i>&#145;enfant terrible&#146;</i> and
            recalcitrant young pup, but he <i>has </i>brought the
