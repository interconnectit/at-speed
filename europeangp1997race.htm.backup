            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>
            became world champion today at the <i>European Grand
            Prix</i> in <i>Jerez</i> after a deliberate attempt
            by <b>Michael Schumacher</b> to sideline him in a
            passing manoeuvre failed, leaving the German in the
            gravel. Villeneuve went on to secure 3rd place, when
            he allowed both <b>Mika Hakinnen</b> and then <b>David
            Coulthard</b> to pass, as he struggled to take his
            damaged car to the line.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The powers that be
            shook their heads tonight in disbelief as a decision
            that the stewards of the race felt they were unable
            to make, could not be ignored. All the fine words of
            warning from both <b>Max Mosley</b> and <b>Bernie
            Ecclestone</b> have, in the heat of the moment, been
            ignored. To sanction Schumacher by banning him as
            Ecclestone threatened he may do, from the first few
            races of &#146;98, would be the natural thing to do,
            but it would only highlight the current lawlessness
            of Formula 1 and fuel controversy over the closed
            season. To ignore it would have the pitlane up in
            arms. Suffice to say the stewards called it a
            &#145;racing accident&#146; and left it at that. This
            will please nobody and the sport will find itself
            saddled with a <i>&#145;Jerezgate&#146;</i> that,
            like <i>Adelaide</i> in 1994 will refuse to go away.
            Had Schumacher got away with it and put the Canadian
            out or, if they had both gone out, he would have won
            the Championship and the penalty would have been
            severe. As it was he only hurt himself and it was the
            ultimately his heaviest cross to bear.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher led the
            race from the start after making an exceptionally
            quick getaway with <strong>Heinz Harald Frentzen</strong>
            taking up 2nd place in front of his Canadian team
            mate. The two McLarens of Hakinnen and Coulthard
            never let go and pushed Frentzen for third place
            after the German let Villeneuve through to chase
            after Schumacher on lap 8. The gap between the two
            front runners remained at a steady 4 seconds as they
            traded off fastest laps and when Pedro Diniz spun
            into the gravel, Schumacher was level headed enough
            to back off fractionally as the yellow flags came
            out.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Frentzen led briefly
            after both Schumacher and Villeneuve pitted, putting
            a team strategy into play by slowing the race on
            their return to the track, to enable his team mate to
            close up on the </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial"> As both McLarens cleared the
            way by stopping for fresh rubber, the gap came down
            from seven seconds to less than one for most of the
            second leg and they both pitted for a second time on
            lap 43 but Schumacher, despite having a slower stop,
            was able to regain the track ahead of Villeneuve, who
            was balked by the 2nd placed McLaren of Coulthard as
            he exited the pit lane.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Scotsman vacated
            his place to Villeneuve when he made his second stop,
            at the end of the following lap, leaving the Williams
            driver clear to continue the chase. Badly balked by

            Said the worried Italian. <i>&quot;Then I let him by
            as soon as I saw him there.&quot;</i> You bet he did
            and sharpish. To have the Championship contender
            bearing down on you at full chat is not a comforting
            experience for a novice.</font></p>

            size="2" face="Arial">then started to inexplicably
            slow and fairly rapidly Villeneuve began to devour
            the German&#146;s lead. Possibly a bad set of tyres
            was the cause but whatever the reason, Villeneuve saw
            the Ferrari go wide, leaving an opportunity at the <i>Curva
            Dry Sack</i>, for him to slip through on the inside
            under braking. As the Williams drew level, Schumacher
            realising that he had made a fatal error in giving
            his rival the space in which to overtake, seemed to
            deliberately and sharply alter course, making contact
            with the side radiator of Villeneuve&#146;s car and
            launching himself into the gravel, his wheels
            spinning ineffectually. It was a tragic piece of
            driving seemingly proving that winning the race by
            fighting to the flag, was never on his agenda and it
            has marred irrevocably a season in which Schumacher
            has shown a new found maturity dominated by masterful
            driving and sportsmanship.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;I wasn&#146;t
            really surprised when Michael turned in on me.&quot;</i>
            Said Villeneuve. <i>&quot;It was a little bit
            expected, so I knew I was taking a big risk. We
            banged wheels and I jumped in the air and I thought
            that I&#146;d broken the car. My car felt strange. I
            could push for a few laps but then I had to slow down
            because the tyres were heating up in a strange way.
            The way he hit me was really hard. I couldn&#146;t go
            more on the inside as I was actually on the grass.
            I&#146;m surprised that I could actually finish the
            race.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher of course
            made no admission of blame <i>&quot;A mistake -by
            me?&quot; </i>He quizzed. <i>&quot;No. I braked on
            the maximum and he braked even later. He must have
            miscalculated his braking point.&quot;</i> Indeed he
            even hinted that the Canadian had been chancing his
            hand a little too far. <i>&quot;He tried a rather
            optimistic attack. It worked fine for him but not for
            me.&quot;</i> Said Schumacher for all the world
            sounding like the martyr that he certainly
            wasn&#146;t. By using Villeneuve as his scapegoat, he
            unwittingly revealed an insight into his own actions.
            <i>&quot;Jacques had nothing to lose and he obviously
            thought he would go for it. To be honest, I would
            have probably done the same.&quot;</i></font></p>

            size="2" face="Arial">team boss <b>Ron Dennis</b> and
            it was therefore, no surprise to see Hakinnen pass
            the slowing Williams on the final lap. Having been
            let through by second placed Coulthard, the Finn was
            confused, but none the less pleased to have won the
            first race of his career.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;I wanted to
            go quicker, but it would be far too risky to overtake
            Jacques who was fighting for the Championship.&quot;</i>
            Said Hakinnen. <i>&quot;I decided to stay behind him.
            Coming into the last couple of laps Jacques was there
            and David was in front. I don&#146;t know exactly
            what happened and it was a strange place to overtake
            David but for my benefit it was fantastic.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So it should have
            been, for the Scotsman was none too pleased that he
            was forced to drop to third when he might have been
            able to take a third win of the season, but was
            clearly under team orders to let Hakinnen take his
            first win. Having his share of good fortune this
            season, cut little ice with him and if Mika
            wasn&#146;t going to have the good grace to tell it
            like it was at the post race press conference, then
            Coulthard in the most diplomatic way possible, was.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;We both had a
            little bit of help from Jacques.&quot;</i> He said,
            his face showing all the signs of being very unfairly
            treated. <i>&quot;I let Mika through to give him a
            chance to push, because I couldn&#146;t make any
            headway into the Jordan and he was able to make use
            of that when Jacques let him through at the
            chicane.&quot;</i></font></p>

            the beginning of the race when he was quicker and he
            stayed out of the battle later on in the race, so
            when he was in my mirrors, it was a question of
            either pushing like a maniac and risking going off
            with the way the car was handling or seeing if he
            made a move and let him through. He made a move and
            David was close also, so I didn&#146;t fight

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A Steward&#146;s
            enquiry over the incident amounted to nothing more
            than &#145;a racing accident&#146;, but <b>Jock Clear
            </b>Villeneuve&#146;s mechanic put it succinctly when
            he said, <i>&quot;How many times have we heard
            Michael praised? I hope that there&#146;s enough
            praise for the way Jacques drove today because he

            way as he did in Adelaide in 1994.&quot;</i></font></p>

            Schumacher was already racing under a one race
            suspended ban and should have been disqualified just
            as Villeneuve was, for a far less grievous incident
            in <i>Suzuka</i>. The Possible lack of gate money if
            Schumacher does not drive in the first two races of
            the season could be a reason for such unwarranted
            leniency, but the magnitude of the situation had both
            cars been ejected from the race does not bear
            consideration and cannot be ignored. If the sport is
            not to be dragged yet again through the mire of
            indolence and corruption, the public if not the
            Formula 1 fraternity has to be appeased. </font></p>

            From the trackside observer, it seemed that

            the race for Renault, but then who knows how the

            him (Villeneuve) because he has had a very good
            season. At the end of the day he has got the result
            and we have to face that.&quot;</i> Who now at </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial">will shake his hand and say <i>&quot;Well
            tried Michael..&quot;</i> knowing that he has
            besmirched to holy name of the <i>Scuderia</i> in
            front of every living <i>Tifosi</i>?</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuve drove with
            finely tuned aggression until lap 48 when
            determination and courage took over and a little good
            fortune was on hand to enable him to have the last
            word. <i>&quot;To win the Championship after
            disqualification at Suzuka feels great.&quot;</i> The
            new World Champion said. He could not resist however,
            a playful dig at Schumacher&#146;s universally
            predicted manoeuvre, when he said finally, <i>&quot;Either
            Michael had his eyes closed or somehow his hands
            slipped on the steering wheel!&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As Damon Hill stated, <i>&quot;Schumacher
            has shown his true colours today.&quot; </i>What is
            certain is that the scarlet cars that graced the
            track up until today will bear a distinctly darker
            hue in the coming season.</font></p>
