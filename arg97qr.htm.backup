            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There were two stars
            in Argentina. Yeah, and I don't mean Jacques
            Villeneuve and his ego. I mean a certain young
            Brazilian who goes by the name of Rubens Barrichello,
            and the quiet Frenchman Olivier Panis. 5<sup>th</sup>
            place in a car that didn't exist until a couple of
            months ago was a brilliant result for Stewart. One
            word: wow! But just as incredible was the performance
            of Olivier Panis. He looked great a couple of weeks
            ago in Brazil, qualifying well and finishing the race
            in 3<sup>rd</sup> position - but to be the best
            qualifier behind the two Williams cars&#133; well
            that's just excellent for the Prost car.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Let's ignore what
            happened with everyone else. They performed pretty
            well as expected - Villeneuve won Pole Position.
            Frentzen did what he should have done two weeks ago,
            and qualified second. Michael Schumacher did pretty
            much the sort of thing that he's been doing for a
            while - he qualified ahead of his team-mate Eddie
            Irvine and in the top six. Ralf Schumacher did a
            pretty good job with a 6<sup>th</sup>, but we're
            getting boring now.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Then again&#133; some
            teams are looking decidedly down in the dumps
            tonight. McLaren? What happened? There you were,
            winning in one of the best looking cars at Melbourne,
            yet at Brazil and Argentina the performance of
            drivers Coulthard and Hakkinen just didn't satisfy.
            David Coulthard came home in 10<sup>th</sup> place,
            and Mika Hakkinen, who had his session disturbed by a
            self inflicted spin, managed to stick the boot in to
            the team by achieving a truly awful 17<sup>th</sup>
            place. Between the two McLaren's you'd also find two
            Benettons - it seems that they're struggling as much
            as McLaren to find some sort of consistent form.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It's strange really
            that these two great teams are having to battle it
            out for position with teams like Prost, Stewart and
            Arrows. This isn't how F1 is meant to be! It's a bit
            more interesting than the two by two grid formations
            of last year though&#133;. Olivier Panis looked
            surprisingly assured in his car. Not for him the
            twitchy fighting of some drivers as the wrestled
            around the twisty track. Instead he gave a
            performance that was worthy of the Professor himself.
            Alain Prost has quite obviously been talking to his
            protegé. It shows. Winning third place on the
            Formula One grid is quite something for a team which,
            in spite of a single win in 1996, has never looked
            like one with serious potential. Of course, last year
            they were called Ligier&#133; this year Alain Prost
            owns the team, and he's deadly serious about success.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The whole qualifying
            session was straightforward. The circuit, though
            slippy and narrow, failed to throw anyone unexpected
            off the track. No red flags, no destroyed cars, in
            fact, the only thing that suffered was a few egos,
            and in one of the nicest stories of the weekend,
            Jackie Stewart's wallet.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Stewart team boss
            had made a deal with Barrichello. The end result was
            that at the end of the qualifying session some small
            object went flying out of the Brazilian's cockpit. A
            watch. A watch which was about to be replaced with a
            Rolex Daytona. It was a promise from the usually
            tight Scotsman that should Barrichello qualify in the
            top ten he'd be in line for an example of
            Switzerland's finest. Rubens will cherish that watch
            as marking the day when the world seemed a
            friendlier, more normal place to be. &quot;I am
            really proud, &quot; he said, &quot;not just for me,
            but for the whole team. We had a lot of problems at
            the start of the session, so Jan &amp; I had to share
            the T-car, which of course is never ideal. Luckily I
            came back to my race car in time to set my best time.
            It's our first time in the top 10 &amp; it feels
            fantastic!&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ultimately there were
            two performances to smile about, and neither of them
            came from the established pros. Let's be happy for
            these two drivers and forget the rest.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Oh, Damon Hill came in
            13<sup>th</sup>, if you're interested - not bad, but
            not brilliant either.</font></p>
