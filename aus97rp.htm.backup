                size="2" face="Arial">Australia hosts the best
                grand prix in the world - doesn't matter which
                city, it is almost always voted the best by most
                people involved. However, once the Australian
                Grand Prix is over, the public forgets. The
                nation has had its weekend in the sun and the
                television networks get on with the business of
                covering other sports&#133;rugby league, in large
                and unmanageable doses.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Over the weekend
                of March 8-9, the local TV network will saturate
                us with the beauty of Albert Park,
                &quot;Melbourne's Showcase To the
                World&quot;(ugh). For the weekend, the only
                Ferraris you see will be on the track,
                Williams-Renaults will be instantly recognisable
                as the dodos who dumped Damon Hill and Benetton
                will be the idiots who lost a double world
                champion.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Come March 10,
                what's F1? Relegated to the netherworld of
                post-10:30 pm on a Sunday night, F1 is no longer
                an issue. No news (unless there is a fatality),
                no coverage outside of two hours on a Sunday
                night, when we're saddled with &quot;our very own
                Alan Jones&quot; and his sidekick Dazza*.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">What a brilliant
                lineup.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dazza knows
                nothing and Alan Jones knows less, despite what
                he tells us and the know-all image he projects.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If F1 makes the
                6pm news, it is usually a poor-quality vision
                bite with someone unlikely flashing across the
                line accompanied by incorrect information.
                On-line magazines are our lifeline as no-one else
                will touch it. The golf and tennis can shove the
                coverage back for up to four hours and have been
                proved not to rate as well, but the network has
                usually paid more money for the tennis or golf.
                More shops are devoted to same, so they make more
                money. Scary stuff. That's without taking into
                account the fact that you can comfortably tape a
                race, but not 18 holes of golf. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Then there's the
                network itself. One marvellous incident happened
                before the screening of last year's Italian Grand
                Prix. During the credits of some awful film we
                saw fifteen seconds of Michael Schumacher firing
                through the Lesmos on his way to a victory.
                Brilliant, 'eh? This was before the supposedly
                live coverage of the race began and here was
                straight-faced Dazza and Allan needling each
                other about their neckties and tipping a Damon
                Hill victory (but only because he's in a
                Williams). Thanks for caring, Channel Nine. What
                always makes me laugh is Dazza's promise to be
                back bigger and better than ever next year.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Motorsport in
                Australia is experiencing rapid growth and F1 is
                growing in popularity. But do the networks care?
                The most coverage the Grand Prix got last year
                was a string of stories over people opposing its
                installation at Albert Park and media hysteria
                over the threats by said opponents to pour oil
                over the track. This year, it has all died down
                and people will be surprised to see cars tearing
                around the streets of Melbourne on their TV
                screens when they're expecting the cricket. The
                race will be big, there will be record numbers
                there and record ratings, but for the rest of the
                year, after all that hard work, Channel Nine lets
                itself down.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">They all said it last
            year and they all said it the year before that.
            &quot;The car feels good, it is quick through the
            corners, there is a lot less underwater.&quot; Or,
            &quot;with our two drivers I feel we have a winning
            combination.&quot; Or, &quot;Overall the car is an
            evolution of last years model but there have been
            some significant improvements that we hope will give
            the car a 1or 2 second advantage&quot; etc. etc.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The single most
            constant thing about <b>Formula 1</b> is its undying
            optimism. Some teams of course, have the luxury of
            hereditary optimism and don&#146;t need to remind
            themselves as to how good they will be in the
            upcoming season(and I think we all know who we are
            talking about here), but the majority need the morale
            &#145;ups&#146; that this enforced confidence
            supplies them with. The business of running a Grand
            Prix would seem to have greater rewards than winning
            a race or the Championship. The acquisition of
            Sponsorship money and corporate entertaining, the
            gainful employment of 50 of 100 skilled people, the
            thrill of the chase, or just the glory of Formula 1,
            what is it that keeps the managers coming back year
            after embarrassing year, pointless and underfunded?
            It must be different things to different people. <b>Eddie
            Jordan</b>, <b>Frank Williams</b> <b>Eric Broadley</b>
            and <b>Ron Dennis </b>are died in the wool racers.
            They have to be immersed in Formula 1 to exist, they
            live through their passion and no matter how
            uncompetitive their team, embarrassment is not in
            their vocabulary, just improvement, evolution etc. <b>Flavio
            Briatore</b> was a reluctant latecomer to his team
            and has publicly expressed more of a business
            interest than a passion for his sport and <b>Alain
            Prost</b> and <strong>J</strong><b>ackie Stewart</b>
            are actively involved figureheads to pull in the
            corporate loot. But that&#146;s OK. For whatever
            purpose you are holding a Formula 1 team together,
            the ultimate goal has to be a win or for some, a
            point and, as the new term begins at <b>Melbourne</b>
            next weekend for the first Grand Prix of the season,
            the optimism will be at a demented level, the self
            hype will be at boiling point and no one will allow
            themselves even the remotest thought that their car
            is going to fall by the wayside or, not get at least
            one point or, for some, where reality and fantasy
            start to blend towards the practical, a podium
            finish.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The holiday projects
            and the notes and times have all been compared and
            assessed. The boys are in their new classes and the
            red light is waiting, like the school bell, to signal
            the commencement of their lessons.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Winter testing at both
            <b>Estoril</b> and <b>Barcelona</b> have thrown up
            widely differing performance figures. The top running
            teams have been constantly pushed by the midfielders
            and the also-rans from last year are showing a form
            that, if only on paper, gives hope that the lower
            half of the grid will see as much action as the
            front.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The consensus of
            opinion remains the same as last year in as much that
            <b>Williams</b> will, if not walk it, have to exert
            the minimal amount of excercise to keep off the
            closing pack. However <b>Benetton</b> seem to be on
            the trail once again after a cheerless year and <b>Gerhard
            Berger</b>(blindingly quick in testing) rather than
            team mate<b> Jean Alesi</b>, seems to be the current
            favourite for the pat on the head and the extra
            digestive biscuits. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Michael Schumacher</b>,
            despite having sandbagged to a degree at the
            beginning of the &#146;96 season with his
            recalcitrant <b>Ferrari</b> managed to claim 3
            victories, one in front of a home crowd at Monza and
            likewise, nothing seems to have changed this year.
            Whilst the press talk about reliability problems and
            instability and the fact that the old spec engine
            will have to be put into service for the first three
            races of &#146;97, <b>Eddie Irvine</b> whips round
            the Team&#146;s <b>Maranello</b> test track in record
            breaking time. Reliable or not, Schumacher will make
            the car look great and he will win Grands Prix this
            year that is for sure.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <b>Frentzen</b>
            and <b>Villeneuve</b> pairing over at Williams will
            be interesting with Jacques, moving his game up a
            notch to put Heinz Harald firmly where he,
            Villeneuve, thinks he should belong. If the German
            remains marginally faster than the Ferraris, then he
            could be seeing a lot of his old nemesis, Schumacher,
            in his mirrors.</font></p>

            face="Arial">A newly dressed <b>McLaren</b> is all
            gung-ho this season with both <b>David Coulthard</b>
            and <b>Mika Hakkinen</b> putting in impressive
            testing times. This was another team that &#145;Could
            do better&#146; last year, but didn&#146;t and
            despite some good performances, remained a
            disappointment. Optimism here, seems to take the form
            of auto kinesis and with the money that sponsors <b>West
            Tobacco</b> and <b>Mercedes</b> have put into
            development of the car and it image, it should roll
            along under its own steam.</font></p>

            align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="149"
            height="125"></font><font size="2" face="Arial">The
            new teams of <b>Lola</b> and <b>Stewart Racing</b>
            and the rebadged teams of <b>TWR Arrows</b> and <b>Prost</b>
            will all be mixing it towards the back of the pack
            all with aspirations of getting points. <b>Damon Hill</b>
            trying desperately to justify his decision to go with
            TWR and covering up for his disastrous testing
            programme said recently &quot; The car is great,
            it&#146;s just a little on the slow side, which
            obviously gives us the greatest potential to improve
            over any of the other teams&quot;. With the now
            infamous unreliability of the <b>Yamaha</b> engine,
            Hill may be wishing that he had taken the Jordan
            offer, as he will probably be seeing a great deal of
            the rear end of that car in the coming races. It is
            unfortunate that the reigning World Champion has to
            suffer the Ignominy of a car that seems to have
            jettisoned all the promise it had at it&#146;s
            unveiling and that his talents should be squandered
            in trying to develop a car, already with a terminal
            disease, that for this year at least will be totally
            uncompetitive.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Two ex world champions
            both have points to prove. Of the two Prost (nee <b>Ligier</b>)
            will be the one to watch. Driver <b>Olivier Panis</b>
            put in some stupifyingly fast testing laps to
            confound even the top teams. With <b>Bridgestone</b>&#146;s
            official announcement that team Prost will be the
            fifth team that they will be supplying this year, the
            car, powered by the <b>Mugen Honda</b> promises to be
            extremely competitive. Stewart Racing has yet to
            perform and despite new<b> </b>recruit<b> Jan
            Magnussen</b> and old hand <b>Rubens Barrichello </b>pushing
            the Tartan Army forward, it will be an added bonus if
            they end up in the points. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lola will be running
            an old spec <b>Ford Zetec</b> <b>V8</b> for the first
            half of the season and even qualifying could be a
            problem. Sponsors, however are not unduly concerned
            as judging by Lola&#146;s reputation and past history
            a championship is but a matter of time. It just
            depends on how much.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Eddie Jordan, changing
            tack when Hill wouldn&#146;t bite, is trying out the
            raw talents of <b>Ralf Schumacher</b> and <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella.</b> Whist quick in testing, neither has
            the experience of Formula 1 racing. We may see some
            improvement by midseason when Jordan could be looking
            at podium finishes.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Probably following
            closely in the Jordan slipstream will be both <b>Tyrell</b>
            and <b>Sauber</b>. Both teams have come up with tidy
            if conventional packages. The Tyrell driver-duo of <b>Mika
            Salo</b> and <b>Jos Verstappen</b> look good on
            paper, yet despite the renewed litany of position,
            points and podium, <b>Ken Tyrell</b> has been out in
            the cold for a long time. This could however, be a
            better year for them. Sauber will be a slightly
            different proposition. Having two times winner <b>Johnny</b>
            <b>Herbert</b> to boost the teams credibility and ex
            Ferrari tester <b>Nicola Larini</b> to exploit last
            year&#146;s <b>Petronas/Ferrari</b> engine, should
            put the team in some point scoring situations. With
            Ferrari rumoured to be using the same &#146;96 spec
            engine at least for the first two races, it will be
            interesting to see if the Sauber chassis is any match
            for the Big Red.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally, a team with
            little hope, but a great deal of aspiration and
            managed by the biggest anorak of them all is <b>Minardi</b>.
            <b>Giancarlo Minardi</b> has a vision and a passion
            for his sport like no other, yet always fighting
            finances, has rarely been within a mile of the
            podium. This could change with the take over by a
            consortium including Flavio Briatore (rapidly
            becoming the Rupert Murdoch of Formula 1) and ex
            driver <b>Alessandro Nannini</b>. The <b>Hart</b>
            engine that powers the car is reliable if a tad
            workmanlike. Using Bridgestones could conceivably get
            the team a point or two in damp conditions, but
            whether drivers <b>Jarno Trulli</b> and <b>Ukyo
            Katayama</b> have the mettle remains to be seen.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The new circuit at <b>Albert
            Park</b> in Melbourne will be used only for the
            second time in its current configuration although
            Australian &#145;Grands Prix&#146; of sorts have been
            held there spasmodically since 1928. It is a longer
            than average lap utilising fast flowing corners and
            slow tight bends, a mix that all drivers had to learn
            from scratch last year. Expect lap times to be
            dramatically quicker this year. The recent
            despoliation of part of the track by alleged
            conservation protesters remains a mild threat for
            race day, but the &#145;bonhomie&#146; and sheer
            exuberance of the occasion should overcome any
            tension that may be present.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So as the lights go
            out on Albert Park, the lights in Britain and other
            parts of the world go on as a bleary eyed audience
            take to their TV&#146;s in the small hours of Sunday
            morning. In that split second of spinning Goodyears
            and Bridgestones, the Bullshit will be left behind on
            the grid with the dissipating fumes of high octane
            fuel. The testing configurations, the light fuel
            loads, the sticky tyres and wing adjustments will
            count for nothing. Each man will be driving for
            himself and his own piece of personal glory. Glory
            however, will come to only one driver this weekend.
            Look for the blues and the reds rather than the
            yellows and whites.</font></p>
