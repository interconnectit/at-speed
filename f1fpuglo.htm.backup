                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;There are
                two distinct parts on the Job: the people and the
                equipment Moving around people involves a variety
                of things the most obvious of which is the
                hooking of hotel These must be arranged more than
                a year in advance and confirmed three weeks
                before the Grand Prix in question. The choice of
                hotel is dictated by the desire, if it is
                possible, to have the entire team in the same
                hotel. On average Peugeot Sport has 20 people at
                a Grand Prix Including all the technical staff,
                the support personnel, the press officer and the
                kitchen staff. There are actually two fewer
                people at the 'fly-away' races than there are in
                Europe as the driver of the truck and the- mo do
                not travel outside Europe.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition you
                have to book all the air tickets. These are done
                four or five months in advance The 20 or so
                people roughly divide into two groups the first
                group are those who are involved in setting up
                Before a race. These are the mechanics, the
                electronics specialists, the software
                engineers(who look after the telemetry) the
                kitchen staff and the logistics manager. The idea
                is for our arrival to coincide with the delivery
                of the equipment. Two or three days later the
                engineers and the Peugeot people who work in
                liaison with Jordan will arrive &quot;</font></p>

                little bit different to other engine

                to Jordan we are also involved in all the
                electronics and the telemetry for the team. This
                means that we have to transport much heavier
                equipment than most of our rivals. In general
                terms, we send eight engines to each Grand Prix
                race. Three others are mounted in the cars and,
                consequently leave from the Jordan headquarters.
                In total we have about eight tonnes of equipment
                divided up into 50 tailormade travelling
                containers &quot;</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;With the
                eight engines there are all the ancillaries. Then
                there are telemetry computers which fit into
                special lightweight, made-to-measure containers
                which the airline companies ask to be built so as
                to be fitted easily into the space available in
                the holds of the aeroplanes. It is logical to
                make life easier for everybody.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The mechanics
                tools are transported in their workbenches on
                wheels, so that they can he used as soon as the
                units are taken out of their boxes. All the
                radios are sent attached to the stand which is
                erected in the pit garage. We also take three
                boxes for the kitchen staff, which include basic
                ingredients, although all fresh produce is bought
                on site. I have one box specifically for all the
                bits and pieces one needs. It is a bit like a
                hardware store filled with rows of different
                plugs and adaptors so that we can cope with the
                different electrical supplies in each country.

                department manager has his own dedicated boxes
                which are then passed on to me, so they fill
                their boxes and I check them in order to prepare
                the necessary documentation for the customs
                authorities. Then we have to weigh the boxes so

                FOCA (the team organisation which oversees the
                transportation of F1 freight) charges us. The
                last thing to be boxed-up are the engines on
                which our engineers are working up to the last
                minute. Then a FOCA truck comes to Peugeot Sport

                which Peugeot's own transport company Gefco has
                filled in. This is a pretty big dossier. Once the

                Aires, Osaka or Tokyo, FOCA looks after the
                formalities of temporary importation into the

                Saturday night before the race. We arrange
                through FOCA and its local handling agent to have
                space cooked on certain flights so as to be
                prepared for any eventuality. On Sunday night we
                sent out another three engines - two of them
                being the race engines. This is not a problem
                because we had space booked for six engines to
                fly out from Paris to Argentina in the middle of
                the following week. &quot;</font></p>

                unexpected problems. That is the only way to cut
                down delays. That means that often we reserve
                space on aeroplanes bu end up not needing to use
