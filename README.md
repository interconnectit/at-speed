# at-speed
 At Speed - David Coveney's first website from 1996.

I've created this as a GitHub repository in order to A, better grasp Git myself, and B, to have a place where I keep the original assets of this in a more controlled way.

http://at-speed.co.uk was created as my first attempt at a commercial website, back in 1996. It uses table based layouts, background gradients, etc, but was reasonably sophisticated by the web standards of the day.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the time or the money to make a success of it and other work took priority and by 1998 I'd closed the door. However, I found an old PC with a copy of the site on it and resurrected it. Let's hope it can live pretty much forever.

As for licenses. I don't currently have the time or energy to check on the situation with respect to the images so I'm going to have to be limited there. Sorry.
