            face="Arial">French Canadian, <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>
            took his <b>Williams</b> to a dominating Victory at <b><i>Catalunya</i></b>
            in what was to be a race won not only by strategy,
            but more importantly by the consistency of the tyres
            that have this season, become so crucial in deciding
            the outcome of a race. It was also significant in
            that it was <b>Goodyear</b>&#146;s 350th Formula 1
            win and yet it might not have been. Whilst sounding
            meaningful, 350 race wins has been relatively easy to
            achieve. Goodyear have had a monopoly in Formula 1
            since <b>Michelin</b> pulled out in 1984 and with a
            mere three wins in the following seven years from two<b>
            Pirelli</b>-shod <b>Benettons</b> and a <b>Brabham</b>,
            a race had only to commence, for Goodyear to claim a
            victory. In effect Goodyear could write their own
            &#145;Hall of Honour&#146; years in advance. With the
            immersion of <b>Bridgestone</b> into the F1 melting
            pot, Goodyear have had to cast aside their
            complacency and, instead of treading water, for the
            past few seasons, they have now been forced to start
            swimming again against an ever strengthening tide.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The circuit at
            Barcelona is undulating and abrasive and with several
            quick and exceptionally long turns, it is tyre hungry
            in the extreme. Pit stops have to be calculated with
            care and today, the Spanish Grand Prix proved, that
            incorrect anticipation of tyre &#145;track life&#146;
            would lead to several promising drives amounting to
            nothing.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a threat of
            rain hanging in the air and several teams, not
            wanting to be caught out for a second race in
            succession had spare cars prepared for alternate
            conditions. The clouds did stay for a while before
            dispersing and the track temperature of 28 degrees
            was cooler than the anticipated 31 degrees that the
            circuit experienced in qualifying. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Drama commenced even
            before the race got under way when <b>Gerhard Berger</b>
            stalled his Benetton at the commencement of the warm
            up lap, enforcing a start from the rear of the grid,
            but seconds before the red light sequence started<b>
            Ralf Schumacher</b>&#146;s hand shot into the air
            signifying that his engine too, had stalled. <i>&quot;The
            engine died on me&quot;</i>, he said <i>&quot;and I
            was penalised and sent to start the race from the
            back&quot;.</i> This gave Berger the chance to regain
            his rightful 6th slot on the grid as the race got
            under way.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuve made as
            perfect a start as team mate <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b>
            made a disastrous one, getting to the first corner
            cleanly. <b>David Coulthard</b> in the <b>McLaren</b>,
            launched himself along the right side of the track to
            stab briefly at the lead before succumbing to
            Villeneuve and slipping in behind. But <b>Michael
            Schumacher,</b> as if shot from a gun and in the
            spare <b>Ferrari</b>, rocketed through the grid from
            seventh place, magically finding space between<b>
            Jean Alesi</b>, Berger and <b>Mika Hakkinen</b>, to
            harry and pass Coulthard on the outside of turn three
            leaving the much annoyed Scotsman to lead the gaggle
            of cars through the opening laps.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was obvious after
            the McLaren set an early quick lap that the Ferrari
            was not the fastest car by a long way and Schumacher,
            as usual, was exploiting all of his guile and
            intuitiveness to maintain speed without losing
            control. He said, <i>&quot;When my tyre blistered, I
            was fighting like hell to keep the car on the road,
            it was sliding like it was in the rain!&quot;</i> By
            lap 13, with the Williams 16 seconds ahead,
            Schumacher was holding up a rapidly closing string of
            cars down to 8th place and was heading for an early
            pit stop, when Coulthard pulled past the German and
            immediately pitted himself, with the Ferrari close
            behind.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The string of cars now
            headed by Alesi and finally let loose, began to
            separate, Coulthard rejoining in 4th and Schumacher,
            missing his &#145;entry window&#146; dropped a
            further two places back. Both Benetton and Williams
            on the Goodyear side were expected to run a two stop
            race whilst the majority, with the exception of <b>Olivier
            Panis</b>&#146; Prost team on a slightly harder
            compound Bridgstone, opted for three and at one point
            as the McLarens slipped further and further down the
            field with each subsequent pit stop, it looked like
            there might be more. </font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As cars made their
            stops, it was alarming to see the toll that the track
            surface was exacting on the tyres. Inexplicably,
            Frentzen had to stop early with badly blistered tyres
            whilst his team mate sailed majestically into the
            distance putting a further 4 seconds on his lead over
            Jean Alesi by lap 17.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Damon Hill</b> in
            the <b>Arrows</b> was running in a strong 6th slot
            when the <b>Yamaha</b> engine let go, the car
            ironically coming to a rest opposite the Williams pit
            , maintaining Hill&#146;s unbroken record of non
            finishes for <b>Tom Walkinshaw</b>&#146;s team. With
            little future in the revised Yamaha tested and
            rejected last week, there seems scant chance of the
            current World Champion humiliating himself further by
            signing on with the team for another year. Undaunted
            and probably glad to have had the chance to be
            competitive however briefly, Hill said, <i>&quot;I
            was knocking on the door of the points and the car
            was going like a train. I thought we must get a
            finish sooner or later. The engine blew up, it just
            didn't last.&quot;</i> There must be a limit to the
            number of &#145;stiff upper lips&#146; that Hill is
            capable of and it is a credit to him, that he seems
            to have a few more still left in the bag.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Further fuel for a
            decision may have come later in the race when Team
            mate <b>Pedro Diniz </b>suffered the same fate. It
            wasn&#146;t only the Yamaha that made a spectacle of
            itself. Ralf Schumacher, having a rotten day in a
            surprisingly uncompetative <b>Jordan </b>- despite
            team mate <b>Giancarlo Fisichella </b>setting the
            fastest lap of the race - retired when his <b>Peugeot</b>
            erupted in a cloud of oil and white smoke on lap 50.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On lap 37, It was a
            pity to see Rubens Barichello setting his car on the
            grass with engine troubles after such a fine finish
            in Monaco. <i>&quot;My engine started making the same
            noise I had heard in the race at</i><b><i> Imola</i></b><i>.
            I didn&#146;t have the strait line speed to
            overtake.&quot; </i>Team mate<b><i> </i></b><b>Jan
            Magnussen</b> who finished a creditable 13th for the
            team, sounded like the &#145;Bad Tempered
            Ladybird&#146; declaring that, <i>&quot;The race was
            very boring. There wasn&#146;t anybody to fight with.
            Only myself the clock and the laps.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Ferrari and
            Benetton of <b>Eddie Irvine</b> and Berger
            respectively, were making the mid field running and
            by the time that the &#145;two stop&#146; teams had
            pitted for the first time between laps 18 and 25, it
            was almost time for the second pit visit for the
            &#145;three stoppers&#146;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lap 28 saw Coulthard
            making a small inroad into Villeneuve&#146;s massive
            advantage and by the time the McLaren was due for a
            second stop, it was clear that the Canadian&#146;s
            tyres were on the way out, but still he kept a
            commanding lead over Alesi&#146;s inherited second
            place.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Positions changed as
            often as the tyres, cars both gaining or losing pace
            and balance from a second or third set of tyres. <b>Mika
            Salo</b>&#146;s <b>Tyrrell Ford </b>suffered a blow
            out that put him into the gravel on lap 35.
            Panis&#146; harder compound tyres seemed to be
            holding out as Coulthard, unable to maintain his
            third position, had to succumb to the
            Frenchman&#146;s pace. The final pitstop by Coulthard
            saw him fade as quickly as Panis started to shine and
            with the second and final stops for him and Alesi on
            lap 44, the finish order was penciled in.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A brief flash of red
            at the front of the field during Jacques
            Villeneuve&#146;s final pit stop was the last chance
            of contention from Schumacher as he then pitted with
            destroyed tyres and slipped comfortably to fourth
            where he remained to the flag. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">However it was
            Irvine&#146;s Ferrari, one lap adrift, in a <i>Deja
            Vu</i> situation from earlier laps, that prevented
            Panis, Alesi and Schumacher from getting through to
            continue the chase after Villeneuve. Panis was
            obviously far quicker and had at that point every
            chance of catching Villeneuve. <i>&quot;I was behind
            Eddie for six or seven laps and I just could not get
            past him. He must have some problem with his
            eyesight.&quot;</i> He said later, <i>&quot;I think
            he saw that the blue flags were being waved. But it
            is impossible to talk to Eddie about anything, isn't
            it?&quot; </i>Irvine on the other hand thought it was
            <b>Jos Verstappen</b> who was holding up proceedings.
            <i>&quot;There were so many pit stops I was not sure
            who was in front of who&quot;. </i>Said the Irishman.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Alesi, eager to get on
            with the race even though he stood no chance of
            passing the Prost, was busy frantically signaling to
            the marshals <i>&quot;..to wake up and do something
            about Irvine.&quot; </i>This they did eventually,
            giving him a present of a 10 second stop go penalty
            which he was obliged to take on the penultimate lap.
            With Alesi&#146;s mirrors full of Schumacher&#146;s
            Ferrari, it was none too soon for him. <i>&quot;I
            knew Olivier would find it difficult to pass, he does
            stupid things,&quot;</i> Said Alesi, <i>&quot;I was
            more worried about Irvine than Michael behind me
            because he is a strange driver.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In vain, Panis powered
            after Villeneuve leaving the Benetton trailing and
            holding off Schumacher. But the positions were not to
            change. With Coulthard on a suspect fourth set of
            tyres, Johhny Herbert pounced from 6th place on the
            last lap to move up a place, his friend the Scot
            unable to control his mal- handling McLaren.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As Villeneuve took the
            chequered flag for the eighth time, surpassing the
            number of Grands Prix won by his father, Gilles, one
            couldn&#146;t help but stifle a small yawn at the
            predictability of it all. With so little overtaking
            action on the track it is a wonder that of the 67,000
            in attendance who couldn&#146;t see into the pit lane
            stayed to the finish. It didn&#146;t stop Jacques
            from being happy. To comeback after two barren races
            and regain his leadership at the top of the standings
            gave him an obvious moral boost.<i> &quot;It was a
            very pleasing day for me and for the whole team.
            After that stupidity in Monaco it is good to win
            again.&quot;</i> He said,<i> &quot;We have thrown
            away too many races this year and now we have to make
            the most of things.&quot; </i>Regarding the ease with
            which he pulled away, he went on, <i>&quot;The car
            didn&#146;t feel as good as it did in winter testing,
            the tyres were different and in the middle of the
            race when the heat picked up it was very difficult
            but, being in front and having Michael (Schumacher)
            second blocking everybody else, gave us a lot of
            help. We planned for two stops and we knew it was
            risky for the tyres, but there is more chance of
            something going wrong when you do three. It was a
            good all-round team performance.&quot; </i>Of course
            it was most definitely not a good all round team
            performance and Frentzen&#146;s three stops <i>did</i>
            go wrong. With the German&#146;s mental abilities
            under pressure, still in serious doubt and his
            inexplicable tyre wear, William&#146;s Technical
            Director <b>Patrick Head</b> was a disappointed man. <i>&quot;I&#146;m
            very happy for Jacques, but we&#146;re having a real
            struggle getting two cars in the points.&quot;</i> He
            said, but excusing Frentzen&#146;s performance,
            continued, <i>&quot;The car was way imbalanced and
            very badly set up. That&#146;s all there is to
            it.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was nonetheless a
            fine drive by Olivier Panis who settled any
            ctiticisms about his inherited win in Monaco last
            year, by trouncing all but one of the leading
            drivers. There were no retirements of any
            significance to give him extra places and it proves
            that the Panis driven <b>Prost Mugen-Honda</b> has
            indeed become a finely honed package and is probably
            throwing doubts into team boss <b>Alain Prost</b>&#146;s
            mind as to the wisdom of his choice to sign with
            Peugeot next season. Despite criticism of his
            Bridgestones during a poor qualifying session that
            left him 14th on the grid, Panis relented, praising
            their perfect race- worthiness. <i>&quot;The tyres
            were too hard for qualifying but for the race, were
            fantastic. They improve all the time.&quot;</i></font></p>

            this will probably be good enough to keep him in the
            team next year, but for the time being at least it
            did please the Frenchman. <i>&quot;We finally found a

            Williams and had Villeneuve&#146;s set up been as
            awry as Frentzen&#146;s, Bridgestone would now be
            celebrating their first victory. It is also true to
            say that had a few more midfield teams been running
            the Japanese tyres, they would have had their first
            victory a lot earlier.</font></p>
