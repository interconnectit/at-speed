            <p><font face="Arial"><b>TROUBLE FREE TESTS FOR NEW
            TYRRELL</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The Tyrell team completed three
            days of trouble-free testing today (Friday) with its
            1997 Formula 1 challenger - the 200 mph <b>Tyrrell
            Ford 025</b> - at Spain&#146;s Grand Prix circuit
            near <b>Barcelona</b>. Summarizing the 025&#146;s
            first dry-weather test, <b>Harvey Postlethwaite</b>
            Director of engineering, commented, &quot; we are
            very pleased with the progress of the new car. It has
            a good handling balance, all three drivers like it
            and report that the Ford engine feels very robust The
            reliability has been excellent and we are all very
            encouraged by the potential the 025 is
            displaying.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Tyrell 's new recruit for 1997,
            Dutchmen <b>Jos Verstappen</b> covered 24 laps on
            Wednesday morning running on wet tyres and a further
            33 laps on slick tyres in the afternoon. It was the
            first time the car had run on slicks and the team
            used Goodyear C compound tyres throughout the three days.
            Jos recorded a best time of 1 min 25.4 sec during a
            programme of reliability tests.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">On Thursday morning Jos ran
            Briefly on new tyres and recorded a fastest lap time
            of 1 min 22.6 sec. He then completed two 15 lap
            stints, making some set-up adjustments to reduce
            understeer after the first stint and finished the
            programme trouble-free except for a small Oil Pipe
            leak as he completed the 30th lap.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Verstappen commented, &quot;On
            Wednesday in the morning, it was wet, so we started
            running on treaded tyres and everything went really
            good, with no mechanical problems but the circuit
            lacked grip because there wasn't much rubber on the
            surface. For Thursday we Began with some runs on
            fresh tyres and then did some longer runs until an
            oil pipe suffered a minor break. I now feel
            comfortable in the car though my thigh still rubs on
            the steering wheel when I&#145;m braking. We tried
            the new master cylinder and I preferred the feel of
            the brakes with that system. The Ford engine feels
            strong. I was delighted with the way the tests have
            gone.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Much of Tyrell's intense
            testing programme in 1997 will be undertaken by
            Japan's most talented rising star 22 year old <b>Toranosuke
            Takagi </b>and he was the second driver to sample the
            025 in Spain. During Thursday's lunch-break, the
            cracked oil pipe was replaced and the 025's seat and pedals
            were changed to accommodate the Japanese driver.
            &quot;He enjoyed his first outing in a Formula 1 car
            in dry weather with slick tyres and covered 29 laps
            during the afternoon without incident &quot; reported
            team manager <b>Steve</b> <b>Neilsen</b>.<b> </b>His
            best lap time was a highly promising 1 min 24.9 sec
            on a circuit he had only seen for the first time on
            Wednesday and overall he did a very professional
            job.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><b>Takagi</b> enthused: &quot;I
            was happy with my first real outing in a Formula 1
            car and I want to thank the team for making me feel
            part of the 'family' so quickly. I look forward to
            testing the 025 again next week at <b>Jerez</b>.'</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">On Friday it was the turn of
            race driver Mika Salo to take the wheel but because
            of<i> </i>early morning fog serious testing didn't
            get underway until 11.30. The 30-year old Finn
            completed a total of 5 laps during a simulated
            race-distance run of<i> </i>three 18 lap stints. The
            car again ran faultlessly and Mika's fastest lap time
            was 1 min 23.3sec &quot;It was my first dry run in an
            F1 car since <b>Suzuka</b> so it took a few laps to
            got adjusted to the grip and pace. Certainly the new
            car has better traction and less understeer than the
            '96 car The 025 is a big improvement and felt very
            Good while the engine has good power and the whole
            car responds very nicely to the driver .&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Final assembly of the team's
            second Tyrrell Ford 025 car is being completed at
            it's <b>Ockham</b> headquarters this weekend and the
            car will be transported to Jerez in time for Both
            Salo and Verstappen to run simultaneously on Thursday
            6th February.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial"><b>IRVINE BREAKS FIORANO RECORD</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Driving one of the 1996 <b>Ferrari
            F310&#146;</b>s fitted with electronics and hydraulic
            components from the new <b>F310B</b>, <b>Eddie Irvine</b>
            established a new lap record for the team's <b>Fiorano</b>
            test track with a fastest lap of 59.77sec on
            Thursday, the first time the one minute barrier has
            been broken. Both Irvine and <b>Michael Schumacher</b>
            are expected to test there again on Sunday before
            going to <b>Estoril</b> with two F310Bs from 6-12
            February. The team expects to have more 'Step 2'
            versions of its V10 engine available in Portugal than
            'Step 1' units.</font></p>

            its continued test programme which is due to start next
            Monday at <b>Estoril</b>. A team spokesman described
            the first run at Jerez as &quot;very encouraging&quot;
            and McLaren is now working to complete a second

            will be unveiled Tuesday (4th) at <b>Monza</b> after
            which the new car will be tested at <b>Mugello</b>
            before drivers <b>Ukyo Katayama</b> and <b>Jarno

            <p><font face="Arial"><b>Pedro Diniz</b> had his
            first taste of <b>Arrows A18</b> motoring last
            Saturday when he completed about ten runs at the <b>Santa
            Pod</b> drag strip in Northamptonshire in order to
            shakedown his car. It all went to plan and he then
            sampled 22 laps of <b>Silverstone</b> on Monday.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Obviously the conditions
            were far from good,&quot; he said, &quot;but I felt
            that the <b>Yamaha V10</b> engine had more power than
            I expected. But as far as driveability is concerned,
            the power and torque bands are quite narrow, but we
            are working on it.&quot; Diniz did a fastest lap of
            1m 37s, while <b>Damon Hill </b>managed 12 laps on a
            wet track at Silverstone on Wednesday and suffered
            hydraulic problems, although the electronic problems
            which hampered his progress at Jerez seemed to have
            been rectified. The Arrows team is scheduled to test
            at <b>Barcelona</b> from 7-9th Feb.</font></p>

            3rd Feb.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">On an icy winter day with
            freezing track temperatures, the 1997 car, with <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>
            at the wheel, completed 28 trouble free laps in a

            added, &quot;The day ran very smoothly with no

            race season will be held at <b>Estoril</b> in
            Portugal on 26 October. The<b>FIA </b>announced last
            week that the <b>Automovel Club de Portugal</b> has
            guaranteed that the required improvements at the
            Estoril circuit will be ready for inspection by 31
            August. The <b>Jerez</b> circuit in Spain was
            standing by to take over if Estoril could not
            guarantee the work would be carried out. While Estoril
            was confirmed, <b>Magny-Cours</b>, the venue for the <b>French
            Grand Prix</b>, has until 30 April to find a solution
            with the French authorities with regard to fulfilling
            the terms of their contract. The organisers are
            confident that the problems will be overcome.</font></p>

            he joined Japanese driver <b>Ukyo Katayama </b>at <b>Minardi.</b>
            Trulli won the <b>German Formula Three Championship </b>last year

            was the Ferrari test driver between 1989-1991. He
            finished sixth in the 1991 <b>Australian Grand Prix</b>,

            Brundle was hoping to retain his seat in the <b>Jordan
            Peugeot</b> team this season, but was replaced by
            23-year-old Italian <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b>.

            <p><font face="Arial"><b>FASTER AND SAFER GRAND PRIX
            TRACK FOR 1997</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">More spectacle, more speed,
            greater safety and a more attractive venue - that's
            the four-way promise of the 'new' Grand Prix circuit
            recently completed at <b>Silverstone</b>. World
            Champion <b>Damon Hill</b> and Formula 1 ace <b>Martin
            Brundle</b> played a key role in devising major
            changes to the beginning of the lap at <b>Copse
            Corner</b> and the four-corner Complex at the end.
            Together with the resurfacing of the entire course,
            circuit owner the <b>British Racing Drivers' Club</b>
            is confident it has restored the 'high speed flow' to
            Silverstone.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">As well as being longer --
            3.196 miles /5.143 km - and faster (according to
            computer predictions by leading F1 teams) the new
            circuit should provide more excitement for spectators
            and a tougher, more rewarding challenge for drivers.
            BRDC Director Martin Brundle commented: &quot;I'm
            hoping that when drivers first tackle the new circuit
            they'll feel breathless because it's going to be very
            fast and challenging, with almost no let up during
            the lap. But it will also be very safe, particularly
            for the spectators and the track marshals, and I
            think drivers will once again look forward to the
            whole lap, not just isolated good bits.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Some of the changes
            post-1994 were excellent and we wanted to keep them.
            The Abbey chicane created a whole new spectating and
            overtaking area, a very technical section and plenty
            fast enough. Clearly the new <b>Becketts</b> sequence
            is also one of the great complexes of the world in an F1
            car. The new Club Corner worked fine, creating potential
            overtaking opportunities. Last year we speeded up
            Stowe nicely and that worked really well.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Some things we didn't
            like. The exit from the fabulous <b>Bridge Corner</b>
            was the braking area for Priory -- that just ended up
            wrong. There wasn't much pleasure in tackling Copse
            and you ouldn't attack the final <b>Priory</b>, <b>Brooklands</b>
            Luffield Complex because it didn't reward an
            aggressive approach.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&quot;An F1 car is a
            thoroughbred and you want to let the thing have its
            head all the way round the track. We wanted to speed
            up the final section, so we've opened the Complex,
            lengthening it a bit and putting a little banking
            into the track in an attempt to make the cars work
            well, so they can keep in close formation for the
            rush to the finishing line,&quot; added Brundle. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Now, you won't have to
            stand on the brakes as you exit Bridge and those last
            four corners should be taken one gear higher. The
            first corner, Copse, should be pretty quick and
            you'll approach Becketts much faster, making that
            three corner sequence even more of a challenge. We
            hope we have achieved a lap where drivers will be
            looking forward to the little left hander at <b>Club</b>
            for some respite...&quot; concluded Brundle.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Construction work to create
            what is hoped will be, a faster, safer Grand Prix

            completed by 22 December, but prior to that the

            and leading drivers from several other formulae
            before devising the final plans which were submitted
            to the <b>FIA</b> for approval in mid-1996.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&quot;During the redesign
            process we became aware that some sections of the
            existing track were in need of resurfacing and the
            decision was taken to resurface the entire circuit,
            to tie in with work required at the modified corners.
            &quot;There have also been criticisms of the amount
            of redundant tarmac at Silverstone, a legacy of many
            track layout alterations over the years. All these
            old pieces of roadway have been excavated and those
            areas will be grassed over -- enhancing the
            appearance of the circuit. For 1997, what you see is
            what you race on!</font></p>

            the view will also be much better. Many of the
            track-side embankments have been raised and new
            grandstands at <b>Becketts</b> and <b>Abbey</b> are
            being constructed, so we expect the '97 season to be
