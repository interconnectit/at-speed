                size="2" face="Arial"><strong>W</strong>ell, of
                course the story everybody's interested in is how
                Lola &amp; Stewart performed. No? Oh, perhaps
                they wanted to know about the progress of our
                favourite Brit driver, Johnny Herbert?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ah... well if it's
                not that lot then it can only be our Damon.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well here it is:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Damon came
                thirteenth fastest in free practice. That's not
                too bad, actually. It's got to be the highest
                anybody's seen an Arrows for a long time. No
                doubt someone will come along and say that Arrows
                actually did really well at such and such a GP
                last year. But truth be told, I don't really
                care. It's too early in the morning for <strong>that
                </strong>sort of research.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill actually
                seemed quite happy about it. And no surprise - on
                the form the team showed during pre-season
                testing they'd have probably been lucky to beat
                Lola out.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">That's right -
                dear old Lola who rushed their car through in
                just a few weeks now seem to be playing the role
                that Forti and Pacific used to - only not quite
                so bad. They're not *that* far off the pace and
                you can see how a bit of development could help
                them compete with the mid to back runners. So
                long as they don't consistenlty prop up the back
                row of the grid they'll be able to keep the
                sponsors happy.</font></p>

                fine job of putting his Ferrari on the front.

                ahead of Villeneuve in Fourth.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The real fun
                starts tomorrow when qualifying starts. We'll see
                the real positions that the cars are capable of
                achieving.</font></p>

            size="2" face="Arial">e had a real televisual treat
            last night. Murray Walker giving us a run-through of
            the track on &quot;The Footy Show&quot; through which
            a bunch of dogs owned by rugby league stars ran. How
            very amusing. Murray didn't seem to know the
            difference and it was all rather amusing. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Over on Channel 7 we
            had Vincenzo Sospiri and Ricardo Rosset being tucked
            into bed by some poor cadet journalist who copped a
            pinch on the bum from Sospiri - &quot;oh, he's the
            Italian,&quot; - straight after they had been racing
            on a Scalextric track. Vincenzo looked particularly
            disappointed when he had to go to bed. Of course, the
            bed was one of those racing-car bases. When she could
            get sense out of the drivers, they just talked media
            bollocks about doing well. Methinks they are staring
            down the barrel of a DNQ and they know it. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Channel 10 continued
            their good-but-awful Mika Hakkinen interview on
            Sports Tonight and gave the Melbourne Public
            Transport dispute a serve. Basically all the tram
            drivers and bus drivers are on strike. Premier
            Kennett called it a betrayal, but if you knew
            anything about Jeff Kennett, he's a fine fellow to be
            calling people traitors. The bottom line is, this
            weekend is going to be a bit of a shitfight on
            Melbourne's streets. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This morning's Daily
            Telegraph has two-thirds of a page of
            &quot;news.&quot; They dispatched some clown to
            Schumacher's press conference where Ron Walker shook
            Schumacher's hand and said what a lovely fellow he
            is. The journalist took to insulting the Grand Prix
            circus saying they should all be certified and
            basically gave Schumacher a bollocking about being
            arrogant. He said that beside &quot;the tall imposing
            Walker...sat a short, grey-haired gentleman you might
            not have noticed even if he had arrived by
            parachute.&quot; Yep, Bernie Ecclestone.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Beside that story was
            the by-now ubiquitous
            Schumacher-playing-down-his-chances story. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Sydney Morning
            Herald's 'Drive' supplement contained a BIG story
            about Jackie Stewart's Stewart-Ford team. &quot;Scot
            to Trot&quot; contained actual fact (gasp!) and apart
            from saying Rubens Barrichello is a good driver was
            surprisingly well-informed and written. Wow! I wasn't
            ready for that. </font></p>
