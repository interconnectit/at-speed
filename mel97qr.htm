                <td bgcolor="#FFFF00"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The
                ITV - any good at F1?</strong></font><p><font
                size="2" face="Arial">Howls of despair rang
                through the homes of motorsport fans throughout
                Britain last year. Why? ITV had won the rights to
                broadcast F1 racing and that meant one thing:
                advertisements.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">ITV promised an
                innovative approach to F1 coverage. Sure,
                everyone thought, but is ITV's approach going to
                be fair compensation for breaking up the action
                with six two minute breaks during every race?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well the evidence
                after ITV's coverage of the qualifying session is
                that yes - things actually look rather good.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">First we had a
                program mid-week with Clive James following Damon
                Hill around for a week or so. Sycophantic, but
                entertaining in a gentle way. Then things went
                quiet until qualifying night.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">And when I checked
                the TV schedules I have to admit to drooling a
                little. First off over the weekend was a late
                night 'behind the scenes' story on Stewart GP.
                Then a two hour show on qualifying - something
                the dear old BBC never did. Great! Then look at
                what's to come...</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On Saturday night
                you can get your F1 fill for what seems like a
                solid 12 hours! First is another Clive James
                vehicle with loads of drivers looking awkward.
                Then we can throw in a race preview or two
                followed by a re-run of the classic 1996 film -
                Grand Prix. Excellent! But it gets better...</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Grand Prix is,
                of course, run live. The program is long in order
                to cover the build-up and then the post-mortem.
                The format is perhaps a little bit on the
                football coverage style, but it's not bad. Jim
                Rosenthal is certainly trying. He'll get better.
                I hope.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the GP is
                over, don't go to bed! Stay up and watch some
                classic Formula One action.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If ITV can keep
                this up then the season will be full of interest.
                If they can't then it could turn out to be a bit
                of an anti-climax.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Time will tell,
                but so far it's 9/10 for ITV.</font></p>

            <p><font size="5" face="Arial"><b>The Problem With
            Arrows...</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Damon Hill
            suffered a dreadful start to his season in barely
            qualifying for Melbourne. At the other end of the
            grid his former team-mate was absolutely electric. </strong><em><strong>Dave
            Coveney</strong></em><strong> reports.</strong></font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b><img
            src="cmelb97.gif" align="left" hspace="0" width="170"
            height="121"></b></font><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>A</strong></font><font
            size="2" face="Arial">aargh! This was one of those
            frustrating qualifying sessions where you never
            really got a feel for what was going on until the
            very end. Even then it was confused by a red flag
            that resulted in a frenetic burst of activity from
            all the teams and drivers.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Initially the topic of
            conversation revolved around what tyres the drivers
            had chosen. New for this season is a regulation which
            makes the drivers choose a tyre compound prior to
            qualifying. They then have to stick with this
            compound right through to the end of the next day's
            race. The idea is to stop the tyre companies
            producing qualifying specials - a trick which leads
            to spiralling lap times.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It seemed that the
            majority of runners were going for soft compounds and
            praying for a reasonably cool Sunday. The Ferrari
            pair of Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine bucking
            the trend and settling for a harder compound.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But less of the anorak
            stuff. On the circuit Jaques Villeneuve started out
            in absolutely stunning fashion. Setting times that
            had the rest of the pitlane questioning the wisdom of
            even trying to compete, Villeneuve looked like a man
            possessed.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After just a few short
            laps Jaques had set a time a whole two seconds clear
            of the rest of the grid. A marker was set - one that
            Heinz Harald Frentzen would need to aim for. You
            could see that it was going to be a mammoth task for
            the German to even try to take pole position.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile, Eddie
            Irvine seemed to be struggling to get some heat into
            his hard compound tyres. Instead of making smooth
            progress it was all smoke and fury.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">And what about Damon
            Hill in his Arrows? Well he must have been regretting
            his move to the supposedly rising team. Problems
            throughout the weekend have left him running few laps
            and getting bugger all time to set the car up for the
            session. Then, to compound things, everything started
            to go wrong with the machine. Everything, that is,
            except the supposedly fragile Yamaha-Judd engine. The
            one consistent theme has been of errors being made by
            a team which is making the Ferrari organisation of
            1996 look slick by comparison.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Eventually Damon
            managed to get some running but the car looked
            frighteningly nervous under braking and going through
            the corners. In fact, the car had suddenly become so
            bad that Hill looked as if he might not make the 107%
            qualification rule....</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Moving further up the
            grid for a moment, the McLaren's <em>looked</em>
            great, but by the half way mark they seemed
            distinctly average. The Sauber of Johnny Herbert
            which eventually qualified in 7th looked better as it
            nestled in on the third row of the grid in 5th.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fortunately for the
            McLaren team, they got their act together and started
            to improve - more than could be said for Jordan. They
            were floundering badly and showing none of the hoped
            for improvement that will be needed if they're to
            start competing with teams like Williams and Ferrari.
            Ralf Schumacher was making things difficult for the
            car as he revealed his inexperience by over driving
            the machine. If he wasn't careful he was in line for
            a trip into the gravel.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the qualifying
            session entered the last 15 minutes Hill still hadn't
            qualified! For the current World Champion this was a
            sorry display by Arrows. Hill himself seemed to be
            wrestling with a car that was badly set up for
            qualifying and you just had to feel sorry for him.
            There's a lot of promise in the car. It's potentially
            very fast, the engine is advanced and the driver is
            one of the very best. Sadly it all comes to nothing
            if the team can't produce something a bit more
            reliable than a twelve year old Skoda.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill then came out and
            set a time that pulled him <em>just </em>within the
            limits. All that he had to hope for was that Jaques
            Villeneuve didn't pull out an even faster lap and
            'bump' him off the back.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Suddenly, red flags
            everywhere! With just two minutes of the session
            remaining and the times seemingly set in stone the
            camera's panned across to the stranded Sauber of
            Nicola Larini. Although not a bad shunt there was
            debris everywhere and the only safe option was a
            brief halt to the session.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Two minutes. Just
            enough time for an out lap and then a final, crazy
            and desperate last attempt at improving your
            position. Most drivers, at least the ones with laps
            remaining, decided to go for it. As the deceased
            Sauber car was winched away it seemed like every F1
            car in the world was being lined up in the pit lane.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The lights went green,
            and just then a spot of gamesmanship emerged from the
            Williams pit. The car of Villeneuve's suddenly being
            wheeled out in front of Frentzen's - there was every
            chance that this could prevent a trump on pole by the
            German. First onto the track was Schumacher. His car
            lowered down it screamed round the circuit with a
            shower of sparks trailing behind, but it was for
            nothing - Frentzen finally did what he needed to and
            put himself into second position on the grid. 1.7
            seconds behind his team mate, but faster than
            everyone else. Villeneuve meanwhile just took the
            opportunity to wear his car out a little more by
            storming around but achieving little.</font></p>
