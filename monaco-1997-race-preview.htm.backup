            has just taken place on a track right in the heart of
            town. It is the Principality of Monaco with its Grand
            Prix which has taken this initiative. The race
            circuit, laid out entirely within the Principality,
            between Monte-Carlo, the Condamine (Port) and Monaco
            proper, works out to be just over 3 kilometres. It
            goes without saying that the track is made up
            entirely of bends, steep uphlll climbs and fast
            downhill runs. Any respectable traffic system would
            have covered the track with &#145;Danger&#146; sign
            posts left, right and centre. It is on a 100 laps of
            this circuit that the first Grand Prix ran...&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So said <i>La Vie
            Automobile </i>on 25 April 1929. And what do you
            know, it was won by a Williams. The car <i>was</i>
            blue, but it was a Bugatti 35B and it was driven by
            an Englishman by the name of <b>William
            Grover-Williams </b>over the 3.18Km circuit at an
            average speed of 80.10 kilometres per hour, setting
            the benchmark for one of the most exciting races in
            the Formula 1 calendar.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Monte Carlo,</b>
            the smallest European state after The Vatican has
            become the playground for the rich and famous and
            specifically the Principality of <b>Monaco</b> is the
            hub, where money sparkles like a golden fountain and
            drops from millionaires&#146; manicured fingers at
            the Casino, valueless, like empty peanut shells. It
            is the summer playground for the fantastically rich.
            The Grand Prix circus is totally in its element
            amongst the celebrity tax-exiles and rent-a-Royals,
            who overcrowd the woefully inadequate pit lanes,
            basking in the reflected machismo that only Formula 1
            can bring.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Corporate sponsorship
            is at it&#146;s craziest height and is a logistical
            problem for all the teams&#146; Public Relations
            personnel. To hire a hotel room or an apartement here
            with a view of the race track - and there are many -
            will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and
            everyone wants a bit of the action, wants a bit of
            the glamour to rub off into their corporate grey
            existence. Businessmen who don&#146;t know the
            difference between Airforce and downforce, who think
            ride height is something that truckers are privileged
            to, and who think that McLaren is a baby carriage.
            Being there is the thing. Drinking the good life
            champagne if only for an expenses paid day and being
            party, just for a microsecond, to the greatest
            spectacle of overindulgence masquerading in the name
            of sport, is their only concern. Blink and
            you&#146;ve missed it and many do but, &#145;check
            out that babe over there with that Verscasse bit of
            flimsy falling off her shoulder, I do think
            she&#146;s giving me the eye! Now <i>that&#146;s</i>
            what I call <i>motor racing!&#146;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course the teams
            have to come, they have to hurtle their fabulously
            expensive projectiles around a street circuit, inches
            away from concrete walls and metal barriers, at over
            147 Kms per hour. They have to suffer the madness of
            Ste-Devote the first corner chicane that has seen
            more shattered metal and carbon than any other corner
            on the Grand Prix calendar, they have to endure the
            mad scrabble for places for service vehicles and
            corporate hospitality tents. In short, it&#146;s a
            bun fight-no one likes doing it, but they all <i>do</i>.
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With minimal space
            available along the harbour, only the top five teams
            usually have the chance to locate their trucks
            between the water and the circuit. Teams in the
            &#145;second division&#146; take up the first two
            levels of the multi-storey car park a good fifteen
            minutes walk away. Battle for space is even fiercer
            this year, because of the increase in the number of
            trucks required to carry extra spares. The pits are
            located on the other side of the harbour, which means
            mechanics need to transport everything across by
            truck and unload on the other side. Once there, they
            have no garage from which to work. Instead, there is
            a small &#145;lock-up&#146; area where cars are kept
            and work on the car has to be done in the pit lane.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But, hey, the drivers,
            to a man, love it. They love the satisfaction of
            completing a race here, driving on an eleven tenths
            adrenaline rush. The proximity of the gates of heaven
            (or hell) to their flailing tyres is but the
            thickness of a chequered flag or a one thousand
            dollar bill and the exhibition of driver skills is
            dependent on the degree of concentration they can
            achieve whilst they try to catch their breath on the
            short sharp straights between tight hairpins and fast
            left/rights. The bigger your balls the faster you go.
            <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b> having watched his grow,
            since his debut debacle last year at Monaco, will
            tell you <i>&#145;It&#146;s fun.&#146; </i>What he
            means is, that given a well balanced, neutral car, he
            can fly as close to the ragged edge as possible,
            without getting his knuckles grazed on the concrete
            and, well, if he does, he does. It&#146;s OK.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even at speeds of 80
            Km an hour it has always been the same. On a circuit
            notorious for lack of overtaking opportunities, <b>Achille
            Varzi</b> and the great <b>Nuvolari</b> in 1932,
            traded the lead over twenty times, sliding their
            great big supercharged monsters through the likes of
            Loews (station) Hairpin, their skinny balloon tyres
            squealing and leaning crazily from the cockpit of
            their cars pushing opposite lock to prevent the rear
            of the car, carrying all the fuel, from crashing into
            a wall. The following year Nuvolari driving his Alfa
            for a young team boss by the name of Enzo Ferrari,
            suffered an engine explosion and was disqualified
            trying to push the smoking wreck across the line. The
            race gained in reputation when 54 year old <b>Louis
            Fagioli</b> crashed and died in the tunnel section in
            1952. <b>Lorenzo Bandini</b> died crashing into the
            chicane exiting the tunnel in 1967 and even <b>Ascari</b>
            had the ignominy of driving into the harbour and
            having to swim to safety. There were also the Glory
            Years, <b>Ayrton Senna</b> winning the race 6 times
            at the end of the &#145;80&#146;s and the fantastic
            battle between <b>Nigel Mansell</b> and Senna in 1991
            when, Mansell leading, had a puncture in the closing
            laps. His race back to second place behind the
            McLaren and his audacious but ultimately unsuccessful
            attempts to pass the Brazilian, were nothing short of
            awesome.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The traditional
            advertising landscape for the tobacco barons has its
            roots in the Monaco Grand prix. It was conceived in
            1929 by cigarette manufacturer <b>Antony Noghes</b>
            now President of the Grand Prix, but then, President
            of the newly formed <b>Automobile Club de Monaco</b>.
            In order to expand the club and have it recognised
            internationally, an automobile sports event had to be
            organised on its own territory. Noghes proposed the
            creation of an Automobile Grand Prix which would take
            place in the streets of the Principality. Being a
            close and personal friend of Prince Louise ll, Noghes
            brought his influences to bear and realised his
            personal ambition, the first race taking place on
            April 14th 1929 under the Prince&#146;s royal
            patronage.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The circuit
            hasn&#146;t changed a great deal since the <i>&#145;ideal
            topography of a natural race track&#146;</i> was
            drawn up in the 20&#146;s. During the 50&#146;s
            modifications to the Ste Devote bend led to the
            shortening of the circuit to 3.14 km and it was not
            until 1973 that the layout underwent further changes
            with another 135 metres of track being added due to
            the construction of the new Swimming pool. This
            section was also the centre of controversy earlier
            this year when much to the drivers&#146; dismay the
            corners were altered further in the interests of
            safety. From the original 100 laps, the race now, is
            run over 78 laps on the 3.328Km circuit.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the wet last year,
            Monaco was no less controversial with only four cars
            making it past the flag and in excess by a few
            seconds of the &#145;two hour&#146; rule. <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b> took a first lap dive into the Armco
            at Portier before the tunnel entrance continuing <b>Ferrari</b>&#146;s
            early season embarrassment. <b>Damon Hill </b>on a
            comfortable lead had an unusual <b>Renault</b> engine
            failure, handing the lead to <b>Jean Alesi, </b>who
            promptly went out with suspension failure. A rather
            surprised <b>Olivier Panis </b>in the admired but
            underachieving <b>Ligier Mugen-Honda </b>took the win
            to the delight of the predominantly French crowd.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Panis stands an even
            better chance of winning this year if the rains come.
            Inspiration will of course play it&#146;s part but
            not nearly as much as the <b>Bridgestone</b> tyres
            whom everyone is expecting to outshine the <strong>Goodyears</strong>
            on a slippery circuit. Bridgestone are taking four
            different types of wet weather tyre to compliment the
            two dry compounds. 1220 in all seems a bit overkill
            but with so little knowledge of the circuit they
            cannot afford to make any mistakes. <b>Hirohide
            Hamashima</b> Technical Director for Bridgestone
            Motorsport commented, <i>&quot;We have no experience
            of Monaco, so we are making a big effort to use
            simulations to gain usable data. Now we must hope
            that the tyre specification we have chosen will work
            well there. At Monaco our main problem is the
            unknown...&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As regards race
            strategy <b>Trevor Foster</b> Race Director with <b>Jordan
            Peugeot </b>said,<i> &quot;Of all the Grands Prix
            this is the one where qualifying is most important.
            There are three places where overtaking is (just)
            possible-at the Loews Hairpin, at Mirabeau and Ste
            Devote- but it is extremely difficult. Race strategy
            is more important than ever as the timing and number
            of pit stops can have a huge impact on where the
            driver finishes. We look at the different possible
            permutations of fuel loads and pit stops and how they
            might affect the teams outcome in the race. It is
            then up to us to decide what effect &#145;external
            factors&#146;- such as driving style or the weather
            may have. Monaco is a slow speed circuit with maximum
            downforce and driver skill is at a premium.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
            src="mo96dh01.jpg" width="375" height="111"><br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Arial">Damon Hill went
            out of last year's Monaco GP with engine failure</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Which is where we came
            in. <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b> found his virility
            enlarged at Imola and Villeneuve is desperate,
            especially after last year, to prevent emasculation
            setting in. In fact no one except Panis and <b>David
            Coulthard</b> who finished second in the <b>McLaren</b>
            can do any worse. Hill&#146;s blown engine might just
            have been a <i>deja vu</i>. However he knows the
            circuit well and if the <b>Yamaha </b>holds out for
            12 quick laps on Saturday qualifying, the circuit
            could give him a grid position within the top ten.
            It&#146;s probably asking too much for the poor boy
            to grab a point let alone finish the race, but if the
            car does let go again, I feel that he will become
            more than just the occasional dinner guest at McLaren
            Boss, <b>Ron Dennis</b>&#146; table. Yes. rumours <i>are</i>
            flying as to who will take him next year. With <b>Adrian
            Newey</b>, Hill&#146;s close friend and ex-<b>Williams</b>
            technical guru on board this August, and <b>David
            Brown</b> his old mechanic filched to work for
            Coulthard last season, it could be home from old home
            for Hill. Both current drivers&#146; contracts expire
            this year and despite <b>Mika Hakkinen</b>&#146;s
            turn of speed and regular points finishes, he has yet
            to deliver paydirt. This could prove to be
            Hill&#146;s salvation. However he isn&#146;t German
            and it&#146;s widely understood that <b>Mercedes, </b>McLaren&#146;s
            engine supplier, would like a fellow countryman to
            power them to victory. Again, all the Germans seem to
            be tied to contracts right now, so how many more can
            the F1 fraternity take? It all remains to be seen.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But not by many of the
            suits that sip their fizz beneath the ornate
            splendour of guilded chandeliers, staring out big
            hotel windows at the colourful blur of buzzing
            machinery. The Rothmans sponsors may have a bigger
            room than the Mild Seven chaps and the Danka sponsors
            might be on the top deck of a bus drinking brown ale
            but probably their collective concern rates less than
            zero regarding the machinations of Formula 1. <i>&quot;Pass
            the canapés, oh, yes I&#146;ll have another glass,
            err... d&#146;you think I can get this programme
            signed by Jacques? It&#146;s not for me you
            understand...&quot;</i> Of course it&#146;s not, its
            for the boys back at the office, a trophy of
            jolly&#146;s having been had and if someone else buys
            the drinks, tall tales to be told down the pub.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Whilst corporate
            sponsorship pays for our enjoyment of sport in
            general, motor races like the Monaco Grand Prix and
            the historic race of Ferraris held this weekend in
            the Principality, to celebrate the 50th anniversary
            of the famous racing marque, bring home the fact that
            it is a stratospherically isolated sport and the
            circle in which it operates is pitifully small. The
            real enthusiasts <i>pay</i> for the privilege of
            sitting 500 metres away in the drizzle for a fleeting
            glimpse, once every minute or so, of a dream. Not for
            them the fine cuisine and the expensive hotels.
            It&#146;s a day trip to the principality or a tent 20
            miles away, but it&#146;s always them that make the
            races and it&#146;s what makes the drivers race. All
            the money in Monaco wouldn&#146;t do that. At the end
            of the day it&#146;s who&#146;s on Pole, &#145;yes,
            it&#146;s me in front of all these people!
