            Australia (Feb 27, 1997)</b> Demonstrators opposed to
            the staging of next week's Australian Grand Prix auto
            race dumped diesel oil on the circuit overnight in an
            apparent bid to sabotage the event, race organizers
            said Friday. The slick, four metres wide in parts,
            stretched from Pit Straight to the southern boundary.
            The damage caused to the track by the fuel was still
            being assessed.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Police spokesman
            Senior Constable David Gamble said the fuel was
            spread by a fast-moving vehicle over around 500
            meters of the track, including the start-finish area.
            Bruce Barrett, a Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade
            inspector, said fuel might have to be burned of the
            track if cleaning with chemicals doesn't work.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Victorian state
            Premier Jeff Kennett said the sabotage was
            &quot;absolutely appalling. It's unforgivable &quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Grand Prix is
            scheduled to be contested on March 9 on the
            controversial Albert Park track, which is being used
            for the second time. Local groups have protested the
            use of the park for the season-opening race, citing
            trees being felled and a lack of access to the public
            park before and after the event. The Save Albert Park
            group, which has campaigned against the Grand Prix,
            denied any involvement with the sabotage. a
            spokeswoman said: &quot;I'm dismayed because I think

            28, 1997) </b>- 36-year-old Italian magistrate <b>Antonio
            Costanzo </b>has rejected the claim made by two of
            the defendants in the &#145;Ayrton Senna&#146; trial,
            that mistakes were made in the process of obtaining
            evidence a week ago. The lawyers of <b>Adrian Newey</b>
            and <b>Roland Bruynseraede</b> stated last week that
            their clients were questioned without being told that
            they could be prosecuted. Newey's lawyer <b>Luigi
            Stortini</b> claimed that Newey had been interviewed
            by investigating magistrate <b>Maurizio Passarini </b>in
            September 1994 without knowing he was a possible
            suspect, and therefore without any legal aid. Both
            lawyers had demanded that the technical evidence,
            which is key to the prosecution case, be ruled
            inadmissible against their clients. He also claimed
            that Newey knew nothing of the charges against him
            until the end of last year, when they were officially
            levelled. Lawyers representing circuit inspector
            Bruynseraede, a member of the <b>International
            Automobile Federation</b> (FIA), also claimed that
            the Belgian knew nothing of the enquiries against

            1997 )</b> The 1997 Formula One season, which opens
            next week in Australia, is being billed as the most
            competitive in years. But there's little argument
            about the man to beat. It's Jacques Villeneuve,
            runner-up for the world title last year behind
            Williams-Renault teammate Damon Hill.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill has since joined

            favorite for the championship.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuve, the 1995
            Indy Car champion, was a Formula One rookie last
            season but still won four races. He was
            self-confident before he ever won a race and even
            more so now. &quot;I know everything now, there is
            nothing for me to learn,&quot; he said. &quot;I just
            have to adapt a bit and improve what I've learned so
            far. ... Knowing the tracks will help a lot.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Before we talk
            about the 1997 Formula 1 season which is afoot to
            begin can we have a quick look back at last year?
            What was it that didn't work out in the alliance
            between Jordan and Peugeot?</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Jordan invested
            a lot in machinery, staff, organisation and new
            techniques. This was essential to raise the team to a
            new level in F 1, But it happened too late in the
            season. The first results of that work were only
            really seen in the preparation work for the 1997 car.
            We nonetheless succeeded in doing the essential
            things in 1996, in the normal development process in
            the course of the season. We made progress with the
            car out not as quickly as the opposition was able to
            do, which was a reflection of our partial lack of
            means with which to do it.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Is that the result
            of mistakes of the young Jordan- team and a lack of
            experience in F1?</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I do not think
            that it is a lack of experience We are engine
            suppliers and in that role we are not in complete
            control of all the elements involved. Our engine was
            competitive and reliable from practically the
            Beginning of the season From the Jordan point of view
            putting in place the things necessary to improve took
            longer than expected. You can't talk about youthful
            errors Because both Jordan and Peugeot had looked in
            depth at the problems we encountered the previous
            season so as not to make the same mistakes
            again.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It was quite
            frustrating, that's for sure. From the statistics we
            can say that the performance of our engine was up
            there with the best in terms of horsepower and the
            delivery of that power. We had some small problems a
            the beginning of the year and we took the immediate
            decision not to introduce development parts and new
            engine specs without being absolutely sure that they
            would be completely reliable, even if this was
            detrimental to the ultimate leveI of performance. We
            needed to test to make sure that the engines finished
            the race without problems. This policy was successful
            but it was frustrating that the effort was not
            translated into more flattering results.&quot;</font></p>

            away without hope of improvement?</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We wanted to
            learn as much as possible from the situation in which
            we found ourselves and use that information to make
            sure that we were wellprepared for the 1997 season.
            And so in June we started to apply ourselves to
            ensuring that our new engine and the car Jordan was
            preparing for 1997 would be successful. We have done
            a great deal of testing work in preparation for the
            start of the new season in the knowledge that this
            year we will me able - with Jordan to develop the car
            much more successfully than we were able to do last
            season know the areas in which our engine can and is
            going to develop in the course of the year. We had to
            ask ourselves the question about what we were going
            to do beyond the end of 1997. This reflection was
            undertaken during last summer and produced several
            different possibilities. Everyone now knows what we
            decided to do concerning Alain Prost.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Working with,
            Jordan we conducted an in depth analysis of he
            problem which held us back in 1996 and looked at ways
            to correct them. Everyone knows that the Jordan
            suffered from a serious lack of grip in 1996. As the
            engine supplier, we did what we could to remedy that
            problem. We have reduced the weight of the engine and
            significantly lowered the centre of gravity of the
            engine. That was something Jordan particularly asked
            for.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>It was a completely

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In fact the
            engine has been in our planning for a long time and
            is a logical development which we decided on a long
            time ago. In 1996 we gave up some development in
            order to make our engine more reliable because we
            felt that it was performing well enough. The new
            engine has been on the cards for a long time and we
            adapted the designs to the specific needs of
            Jordan.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Monsieur Calvet
            (the President of Peugeot) has Been very clear on
            this. When we studied the various options the Balance
            swung towards a decision to withdraw from Formula 1
            in 1998. This was because of economic reasons, as the
            European car market is very unstable and a price war
            is intensifying. The programme which Alain Frost
            proposed to us was sufficiently interesting to make
            us decide to enter into a three-year partnership with
            his team.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In the contract
            that we had with Jordan this was not excluded for
            1997 although we had to warn them about it in June
            1996. At that point we told them that we were going
            to continue on an exclusive basis. For 1998 we have
            an exclusive deal with Alain Prost although if we
            reach an agreement to continue the relationship with
            Jordan we will be able to do it. Whatever the
            outcome, if we want to supply our engine to two teams
            next year it can only be to Prost and to Jordan. If a
            decision is taken to do this, it will be no later
            than June 1997 as this would create technical,
            financial and logistical problems which are currently
            not sorted out. This option will only happen if
            Jordan makes an exceptional start to the season in

            highlighted the fact that an F1 engine-maker is only

            things which convinced us to make an alliance with
            Alain was that we are going to be partners. We will
            have the chance to have more say than in a
            traditional relationship. We are one of a group of

            liked to have seen Damon Hill in a Jordan-Peugeot. We
            are sure that in 1997 Giancarlo Fisichella and Ralf
