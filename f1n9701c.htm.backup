        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="5" face="Arial"><b>T</b></font><font
            face="Arial">he past couple of weeks have been filled
            with the ballyhoo of new cars being unveiled and amid the
            swishing of the sheets, the skirl of the pipes popping
            fireworks and all manner of razzmatazz the feeling of
            optimism springs unbounded.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><b>Benetton</b> team's launch
            of their new B197 car amid the glamour of the Planet
            Hollywood restaurant in London, was marked by <b>Gerhard Berger&#146;s </b>delight
            at having been extremely impressed with the new car.
            Both Berger and <b>Jean Alesi </b>have already pre
            tested the B197 at the Jerez circuit, Spain, over the
            past two weeks, and despite some misgivings about
            it&#146;s behaviour through corners being similar to
            last year&#146;s model, are optimistic about the
            car's performance: &quot;We have done some good
            testing and we were at the top of the times, which
            was good, but more important we have shown we are
            reliable,&quot; Berger said. <b>Benetton</b> and<b>
            Williams</b> will both use the <b>Renault RS09</b>,
            Renault's latest and lightest version of their V10
            engine. <b>Alessandro Benetton</b>, President of
            Benetton Formula, praised the hard work of the team
            over the last few months. &quot;We feel prepared and
            will be able to pose a serious challenge to our
            competitors.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The car itself is, like most
            cars unveiled this year not radically from last years
            model. The nose is 30mm narrower than the &#146;96
            version and it drops to a &#145;lowline coke bottle
            waisting&#146; towards the rear. Despite Team Boss
            Flavio Briatore believing that Ferrari will take the
            crown this year even possibly and unpredictably
            beating Williams <i>(see Jerez testing story)</i> he
            puts his own chances as equal to <b>McLaren&#146;s</b>
            which is rather an odd way of saying that you could
            be in with a chance. Even odder was Bergers rather
            ambiguous comment, &quot;We are here this year to win
            the championship again and if we do not we will not
            have succeeded.&quot; Err..exactly.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial"><b>AGIP PETROLl,</b> with its
            20-year experience in Formula One, will supply the <b>Mild
            Seven Benetton Renault</b> Team with their technology and
            environmentally safe fuels and lubricants. The partnership
            agreement extends also to a programme of joint
            marketing strategies. Also new to the team this year
            is <b>AKAl</b>, a recognised leader in the Consumer
            Electronics Industry. Although advanced audio visual
            equipment comprises the bulk of AKAI's business, the
            company diversifies into other products, such as high
            grade professional Electronic Musical Instruments and Recording
            Products. <b>James H Ting</b>, Chairman and President
            of AKAI ELECTRIC Co. Ltd, said, &quot;This
            sponsorship agreement, which represents a significant
            financial investment for AKAl, marks a new milestone
            and a major step in our will to strengthen the brand
            on the global market.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The <b>Ferrari F310B </b>made
            it&#146;s debut on Jan 7th. Sporting new sponsor <b>Marlboro&#146;s</b>
            big white &#145;Go faster stripes&#146; and a little
            harsher on the eye in its new Tomato - Soup - red
            colour scheme, the <b>John Barnard</b> design sported
            few modifications. A slightly &#145;squarer&#146; mid
            section with revised rear diffusers and a slightly
            higher nose was all that was visible. Aerofoil shaped
            front suspension arms are also expected be fitted.
            This will probably be Barnards last car for Ferrari
            before he jumps ship - if rumours have it - to the <b>Ligier</b>
            team, to work alongside his old friend <b>Alain Prost</b>.
            Fully aware of the flaws in his design last year he
            said rather cryptically, &quot;None of the
            improvements is a dramatic step. You can change the
            stability of the numbers you achieve and the way the
            car will behave and that&#146;s what we are
            expecting&quot;. It would seem that he has been
            spending too much time around Berger as he said with
            caution &quot;I think we are getting close to winning
            the world Championship. We nearly managed it at the
            end of my last spell at Ferrari but the difference
            now is that it&#146;s more difficult to get an edge.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Jan 9th saw the launch of the
            eagerly awaited new <b>TWR Arrows-Yamaha A18</b> at
            the Autosport International show in Birmingham. It
            was clear that <b>Damon</b> <b>Hill</b> was as
            pleased as punch as he threw the wraps away from the
            blue and white car amid the crackle of fireworks.
            &quot;I think it's a sexy little number. I've got a
            great winning record and there's no reason why I
            can't win a Grand Prix in this car.&quot; He smiled
            &quot; I've had a good period celebrating the championship
            , but now I've had enough champagne and I'm raring to
            go again. There's every opportunity for this team to
            do extremely well, but I'm also under no
            illusions.&quot; He went on: &quot;I don't see why I
            can't win. The car's very slim, very impressive and I
            was very excited when I saw it last night.&quot; The
            car is yet another derivation of a proven design
            concept. Chief designer <b>Frank Dernie</b> has based
            the A18 partially on his own design for the &#146;95
            Ligier for whom he worked last year with the <b>TWR
            Group</b>. A secret &#145;feature&#146;, that &#145;Nobody&#146;s
            done before&#146;, could be the turning point for the
            team. It is supposedly based around a rear end
            extension that is load bearing and able therefore to
            carry a heavier and hopefully more substantial Yamaha
            engine. &quot;It&#146;s a development of the best
            bits that I&#146;ve done with Ligier and the best that <b>Arrows</b>
            have done over the past couple of years&quot; He
            said. This of course does not bode well for the team
            as a whole , looking back on both their records.
            Apart from a rather flukish win from <b>Olivier</b> <b>Panis</b>
            at Monaco, there is little in the bag that seems
            worth salvaging. However with a radically re jigged
            Yamaha engine by mid season and the possible
            advantage that Bridgestone tyres may bring in the
            early rounds Hill and even Tom Walkinshaw who is
            convinced that the team can put one race win under
            their belts this year, could be right. The Arrows
            went on to Silverstone the following day for a test
            but Hill managed just one lap due to gearbox software
            problems. Despite lapping in near darkness and with
            the unnerving experience of only being able to see
            three car lengths ahead, he still declared: &quot;I
            know my way round Silverstone with my eyes closed
            anyway! It was a bloody good start and I was really
            pleased because there was a lot of tension before we started.&quot;
            Yet paradoxically Hill is quoted later as saying
            &#145;I&#146;ll be amazed if we win a race this
            year&#146;. Another member of the Berger discussion
            group perhaps.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">No such nonsense however from
            Team <b>McLaren</b> who gave the Formula 1 press a
            sneak preview of its new car the <b>MP4-12</b> last
            week. Painted in original McLaren orange with its
            model number emblazoned diagonally across the bonnet
            in silver it is indeed striking and is probably the
            most redesigned car in the field. In line with the
            updated FIA technical regulations, the MP4-12
            features a rear impact zone, collapsible steering
            column, reduced winglets areas and suspension
            designed within the limited aspect ratios designated
            by the technical regulations. There have also been a range
            of aerodynamic changes and further use of composites
            within the rear suspension. The nose too, is
            unfashionably, 20mm lower than last years car. A
            newly packaged version of the longitudinal transmission
            introduced in 1996 will be in place for a second
            season and the cooling system has also been
            re-designed to capitalise on internal air flow. Already
            rated by some as the best engine of last year, the
            revised <b>Mercedes - Benz FO110E</b> is based on the
            development work during last season. Team boss <b>Ron
            Dennis</b> typically keeping a level head stated that
            he was making &quot;a conscious effort to play down
            my own expectations. I&#146;m not going to make any predictions
            about the success of the car..&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><b>Ligier</b> unveiled
            it&#146;s new model at the <b>Sporting Club of Monaco</b>
            on January 21. Driver Olivier Panis took the car for
            a brief spin around Casino square and part of the
            Monaco Circuit - conveniently opened for the <b>Monte
            Carlo Rally</b> - in a nostalgic rerun of his
            extraordinary win in &#146;96. New technical director <b>Loic
            Bigois</b> has wisely stayed on the path mapped out
            by former designer <b>Frank Dernie</b>, now with
            Arrows, in keeping the new <b>Ligier JS45</b> similar
            to it's predecessor. &quot; It&#146;s a continued
            development of the JS43 with a completely new
            monocoque.&quot; Said Bigois &quot;We have done a big
            job in the wind tunnel trying to solve the problems
            we had last year with sensitivity and efficiency on
            high speed circuits.&quot; The high nose has been
            retained and slightly &#145;flattened&#146; and a
            brand new Ligier gearbox is to be used, as opposed to
            the one borrowed from sister team Benetton last year.
            Ligier managing director <b>Bruno Michel</b> said:
            &quot;Improvements have been made in some sections.
            We were not happy with the brakes and that's one
            thing that has been worked on but the engine is also
            more powerful.&quot; The Mugen-Honda engine will have
            some revisions internally and as announced earlier, Ligier
            will use Bridgestone tyres. Panis and newcomer <b>Shinji
            Nakano</b> were quite optimistic about their chances
            for 1997 and hope to score points on a regular basis. <b>Olivier
            Panis</b> didn't even rule out a single victory this
            season. Panis said: &quot;To win one race or more and
            to finish regularly in the points will be our goal
            this season.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Despite reports of hitches in
            Frenchman <b>Alain Prost</b>&#146;s attempts to take
            over the team of Ligier, current owner <b>Flavio
            Briatore</b> said: &quot;A lot of progress has been
            made and I believe we can go even further. We are
            talking and I hope we will reach an agreement but I
            don't know when. If there is an agreement, very well,
            but if not, we will continue to work. Ligier is now
            almost a top team and can still improve.&quot; He
            added: &quot; The team is not for sale to anybody
            else. Whatever happens the future of Ligier is
            assured.&quot; It is thought that <b>Mugen Honda</b>
            might be on their way out to make room for Peugeot in
            1998 and this is where the problems lie. <b>Prost</b>
            has already obtained permission from the <b>FIA</b>
            to change the name of the team to his own. The <b>FOCA</b>
            has also agreed to do likewise.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><b>The Tyrell Racing
            Organization</b> presented their new car today in
            London to the sounds of Carl Orff&#146;s Carmina
            Burana. In keeping with the conservative swing in all
            this years car designs, <b>Dr.Harvey Postlethwaite</b>
            echoed the sentiments of the majority of technical
            directors and designers when he said, &quot;The car
            is a logical development of the previous model.&quot;
            The most striking detail on the new car is the single
            long central pillar support for the front wing. The
            strength of this design was proved , by supporting
            the combined weight of both drivers standing on the
            wing. The team not surprisingly are glad to see the
            back of the troublesome <b>Yamaha V10 </b>that they
            have endured for the past four years. Last year alone
            they suffered over 50 engine failures. Deputy
            technical director <b>Mike</b> <b>Gascoyne</b>
            explained. &quot;We had a lot of problems with the
            Yamaha. I didn&#146;t pull well from low revs, it
            didn&#146;t have low down power, it had bad torque
            characteristics and it was unreliable.&quot; This is
            indeed a fairly damming condemnation of the engine
            with which the<b> TWR Arrows Group</b> hope to power
            current world champion <b>Damon Hill</b> to podium
            positions. He went on, &quot;The Cosworth V8 should
            be better in terms of traction,
            &#145;drivability&#146; and reliability and Cosworth
            has made a lot of gains on the power side.&quot; The <b>Ford
            Cosworth EDV8 </b>currently has already gained 8%
            power on last year's version and, according to the
            Ford engineers, their objective is to find a power
            gain of 15% this season. Despite expectations to the opposite
            the team will use <b>Goodyear</b> tyres and not <b>Bridgestone</b>
            this year. Gascoyne expects the Bridgestones to be a
            little quicker but a lot softer. &quot;Everyone will
            be doing two or three pit stops and if you get it
            wrong, some will be doing four or five&quot;. Drivers
            Mika Salo (in his third season for the tream) and Jos
            Verstappen are reckoned to be the most competitive of
            the new young driver line ups. Refering to the colour

            signed to be Ferrari&#146;s test driver for 1997. The
            Italian who has just celebrated his 29th birthday,
            test drove for Ferrari in 1995. Last year he didn't
            compete in F1 but the two years before he drove for

            <p><font face="Arial">Problems beset both the Ferrari
            of <b>Michael Schumacher</b> and the Arrows of <b>Damon
            Hill</b> on all three days testing at Jerez in Spain
            when mechanical problems cut short their Formula One testing. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Hill had been hoping for the
            first serious run in his new <b>TWR Arrows</b> car.
            He managed to complete eight laps in the morning
            session on Wednesday 22nd and one lap into the
            afternoon re-start before being sidelined in the pits
            by a seized engine and a recurring gearbox software
            problem. He failed to set any realistic time.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Schumacher's <b>Ferrari</b>
            suffered the fourth major engine failure since the
            launch of the new F310B at Fiorano earlier this
            month. &quot;I can't say yet, what is wrong, the
            engine will be checked,&quot; said the two times
            world champion. Schumacher heard a strange sound, and
            ended his test session after 28 laps. Earlier in the
            week, attempting to cover a Grand prix distance
            another engine blow up caused him to spin onto the
            grass alongside the main straight and the rear of the
            car quickly caught fire. Although he escaped unhurt
            and the car was only slightly damaged, it will hardly
            have impressed Schumacher who reportedly hinted to
            Ferrari bosses this week he is not entirely satisfied
            with the overall performance of his new car. By the
            end of the final session in Spain however, Schumacher said
            that he was not disappointed. He said, &quot;Despite
            the problem with the engine, I am quite satisfied
            with the work we have accomplished. The car proved to
            be well balanced and its handling is consistent, in
            terms of both tyre and brake wear. It is also
            encouraging to have covered 1200 km in six
            days.&quot; </font></p>

            a second quicker eventually than teammate <b>Ralf
            Schumacher</b> while driving fewer laps. However the
            pecking order soon established itself and despite
            minor gearbox problems and an engine change, <b>Frentzen</b> reasserted
            himself at the head of the field by the following
            day. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The new <b>Stewart Grand Prix</b>
            team also made an impressive start to their first
            Formula One season by producing some fast times in
            early testing at the Jerez circuit. Brazilian driver <b>Rubens
            Barrichello</b> set the pace ahead of his rookie
            Danish team mate <b>Jan Magnussen </b>but

            stated that the <b>MP4-12</b> was the best McLaren he
            had ever driven, setting an impressive 1m 22,75 secs
            lap during his 65 laps running. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Despite <b>Gerhard Berger</b>
            setting fastest overall time on the first day of
            testing and smashing Schumachers Lap record to boot,
            team boss Flavio Briatore remained quietly
            pessimistic about the teams prospects, tipping
            Ferrari to win the world title. &quot;Williams, as
            usual, will be stable and competitive,&quot; he said
            &quot;But McLaren will be strong too, and so will we.
            It will be a very open and exciting
            championship.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial">Lawyer <b>Roberto Causo</b> has
            decided not to defend <b>Frank Williams</b> and the
            other members of the Williams team in the trial on
            the death of Ayrton Senna. This decision stems from
            the fact that Williams' line of defence is going to
            be to blame the death of Senna on the conditions of
            the track at Imola. Before the <b>San Marino GP</b>,
            Williams had signed, like the other teams, the
            official document accepting that the track had no
            responsibilities for what might happen during the
            race. Signing this document is standard procedure and
            follows the approval of a track by the <b>FIA</b>.
            This means that the Williams team will be accusing
            Belgian <b>Roland Bruynseraede</b>, who approved the
            track on behalf of FIA. Roberto Causo also is the
            lawyer of Bruynseraede, therefore he cannot be
            Williams' lawyer at the same time. Williams has
            already nominated <b>Oreste Dominioni</b> as new
            lawyer. The Williams team will find themselves in the
            position of saying at the trial &quot;we blame the
            track, even though we signed a paper accepting that
            it was safe before the event&quot;.</font></p>

            Hill's Bridgestone tyres to be an important factor
            and said: &quot;I don't think we have seen Damon
            winning a race for the last time. Damon is a very
            good racing driver and I am sure he will win and be
            back on the front row of the grid again.&quot; The
            Berger school of reasoning strikes again and while

            gossip is not very positive for Hills chances this
