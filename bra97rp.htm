            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>&#145;Fat
            Tuesday&#146;</i></b> has been and gone in <b>Brazil</b>.
            The costumes, the headdresses, the samba and the
            floats are all now locked away in various low rent
            suburbs of <b>Rio De Janeiro</b> until next year. The
            hangovers have cured themselves, the poor people, the
            petty crooks and pickpockets now have to jettison
            their fantasies and transient illusions to become the
            real people that they were before <i>&#145;Carnival&#146;</i>.
            But the daydreaming can linger for just a little
            longer as, in the bars of nearby <b>Sao Paulo </b>and
            in the squalid cardboard <i>favelas</i> of its
            sprawling suburbs, watched over by revered images of <b>Ayerton
            Senna</b>, <b>Nelson Piquet</b>, <b>Emerson
            Fittapaldi</b> and New hero <b>Rubens Barichello</b>,
            talk turns in earnest to the merits of their
            courageous Countrymen and how they rate in the
            Brazilian hall of hero&#146;s. Grand Prix fever is
            upon the masses and, in the greatest show of
            capitalist propaganda in the world, the Formula One
            State Circus lands on the shores of South America,
            strutting its extravagant finery, putting on
            it&#146;s own costumes and plumage and averting its
            eyes from the poverty and squalor surrounding it. The
            people of Sao Paulo and Rio don&#146;t care. Their
            passion is motor racing and their drivers, like their
            Italian counterparts, are Gods. The definite
            possibility in years past of Fittapaldi or Senna
            winning the Brazilian Grand Prix would be enough to
            give the jaded revelers a touch more incentive for
            dancing in the streets.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some Brazilians will
            tell you that the Golden age passed with the death of
            Senna yet the younger fans will remember last
            year&#146;s stunning performance by current <b>Stewart
            Grand Prix</b> driver, Barichello who put his <b>Jordan
            Peugeot</b> on the second row of the grid to the
            unbridled jubilation of the whole of Brazil, albeit a
            second short of World Champion, <b>Damon Hill</b>&#146;s<b>
            Williams Renault</b>. He said recently of last years
            race: &quot; Last year in Brazil I had one of the
            best races of my career. It has normally been a good
            circuit for me. I put the car on the front row and I
            think that meant more to me than my pole position in
            Spa&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The circuit of <b>Interlagos</b>
            is tightly packed into a natural amphitheatre close
            to the urban sprawl of Sao Paulo, South
            America&#146;s fastest growing city. Anticlockwise,
            it winds around itself crossing a lake in a 2 and a
            half mile mixture of sweeping bends, high speed
            straits and sharp hairpins. All the drivers complain
            about the inherent &#145;bumpiness&#146; of the
            circuit and despite regular, but half hearted attempt
            to flatten them, the problem still persists. From an
            engine point of view according to European Director
            of Ford Motorsport <b>Martin Witaker</b>, &quot;Power
            is obviously important because of the long straits,
            but a lot of lap time comes from flowing smoothly
            through the series of slow corners behind the pits.
            For an engine this means that driveability and
            smoothness of power delivery are vital.&quot; Sub
            tropical climate makes the weather extremely
            unpredictable. Last year an unexpected downpour half
            an hour from the start, turned the race into a
            lottery. It was won in commanding manner by Hill
            providing the platform from which to build his
            Championship title. Barichello, despite running a
            feisty race and for two laps running a close second
            to Hill, unfortunately spun out on lap 60 out of 70. <b>Jean
            Alesi</b> another Wet weather maestro had his highest
            finish of the season finishing second in front of <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b>. It went downhill for him from then
            on.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the tyre war
            promised at Melbourne not materialising, there could
            be some fireworks this weekend if it rains, as <b>Bridgestone</b>&#146;s
            wets have proved to be dominant in winter testing
            giving as much as a four seconds a lap advantage over
            <b>Goodyear</b> shod cars. The back markers are
            almost exclusively on the Japanese rubber so some
            midfield skirmishing could be a possibility before
            the big boys assert themselves.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Both Benson &amp;
            Hedges Jordan</b> drivers <b>Ralf Schumacher</b> and <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella </b>will be racing in Brazil for the first
            time for a Formula 1 team. It is probably hard for
            Jordan Peugeot Boss <b>Eddie Jordan</b> not to have
            misgivings about his two raw recruits especially as
            Fisichella suffered a massive shunt attempting to do
            a race distance recently. But, always at the
            forefront in spotting new talent, he must take heart
            in the fact that his 24 year old German protégé
            Schumacher, was fastest by a country mile during the
            same testing session last week at <b>Silverstone</b>.
            This included the times of recent race winner <b>David</b>
            <b>Coulthard</b>&#146;s <b>West McLaren Mercedes</b>
            but not significantly, the Williams&#146; who were
            brake testing elsewhere. The Italian was lucky to
            have suffered nothing but a bruised knee and will be
            fully recovered for the coming race weekend.
            According to Technical Director <b>Gary Anderson</b>,
            &quot;We had not planned to test the new <b>FIA</b>
            rear impact structure, but we can reassure everyone
            that it works very well! Fisichella went off at Stowe
            doing 220kph and within 0.72 of a second was at a
            standstill. This represents a deceleration of between
            11 and 12g. Without the new rear impact structure,
            the damage could have been quite severe.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It probably won&#146;t
            be the World Champion that will be the crowd&#146;s
            point of focus, but new team mate <b>Pedro Diniz</b>
            who finished a creditable 8th last year in the <b>Ligier
            Mugen-Honda</b>. Not much chance of that this year,
            but the Fans will cheer him on and turn the Samba up
            loud as he passes. The <b>Arrows</b> team will regard
            it as a plus just to be able to <i>start</i> the race
            at Interlagos and their best hope is to finish.
            Hill&#146;s <b>Arrows A18</b> was more than 2 seconds
            slower than <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>&#146;s Williams
            in testing at <b>Paul Ricard</b> last week</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is still Williams
            that is expected to take the first, if not second
            prize despite their poor showing in Melbourne. <b>Heinz
            Harald Frentzen</b> could be the hot favourite even
            with a flea in his ear from Williams Chief engineer <b>Patrick
            Head </b>who has let it be known that Frentzen was
            partly to blame for his shattered brake disk by over
            braking with simultaneous use of the throttle. This
            could make Frentzen a more cautious driver, leaving
            the way open for Jacques Villeneuve, a man who will
            give no quarter and certainly not to his team mate
            who is constantly trying to upstage him.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Second equal in the
            pecking order and which could provide some
            excitement, are the <b>McLaren</b>s and the <b>Ferrari</b>&#146;s.
            <b>David Coulthard</b> turning the expected
            procession of the Australian Grand Prix into an
            entertaining race by winning it - ending a 49 race
            drought for Team Boss<b> Ron Dennis</b> - and putting
            Schumacher in the middle of a silver sandwich, the
            bottom slice being <b>Mika Hakkinen</b>. Coulthard
            however, is realistic about his chances of a second
            win. &quot;I&#146;m not filling myself with false
            hopes,&quot; he said after the race, &quot;I was 1.7
            seconds off pole position and its doubtful that I can
            make that up in Brazil&quot;. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Ferrari&#146;s
            reputation for its unreliability could make the
            weekend a bit of a struggle for them. However <b>Eddie
            Irvine</b> says,&quot; The car is promising and
            we&#146;re finding improvements all the time.&quot;
            After taking out both <b>Johnny Herbert</b>,
            Villeneuve and himself in Melbourne and unwittingly
            opening the race up for the rest of the field, Irvine
            remains unrepentant despite the majority of media
            opinion that, true to recent form, the Irishman tried
            to dive through the barn doors before they were fully
            opened. Writing in the <b>London Times</b> this week,
            he said, &quot;Villeneuve was asleep when the lights
            signaled the start, but refused to concede he would
            have to lose places because of his mistake. He
            won&#146;t be making a start like that again in a
            hurry or he won&#146;t be winning the
            Championship&quot;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The only other
            possible challengers could be the Benettons of Alesi
            and <b>Gerhard Berger</b>. Disappointing themselves
            badly in Melbourne due to a major error in setting up
            the cars and, compounded by Alesi&#146;s blatant
            disregard for his crews pitboard instructions to pit
            for fuel, Boss <b>Flavio Briatore</b> must surely be
            looking for nothing short of a win to claw back
            Benetton&#146;s rapidly diminishing credibility as a <i>force
            majeur</i> . Chief designer <b>Nick Wirth</b>, said
            of Benettons blunder, &quot;It was a car problem and
            I&#146;m disappointed we didn&#146;t pick it up
            earlier. I&#146;m just gutted about it.&quot; Despite
            Berger narrowly missing a podium step by only seven
            tenths of a second, the management will look to him
            rather than the Sicilian to provide the result that
            the team so desperately needs.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Best of the new
            Bridgestone runners after the first race of the year,
            were the new teams of World Champion&#146;s <b>Alain
            Prost</b> and <b>Jackie Stewart</b>. Looking forward
            to Brazil Stewart said, &quot;We must be careful not
            to set our sights too high after Ruben&#146;s
            excellent qualifying effort in Melbourne. We&#146;ve
            had little testing since then, alas, so we don&#146;t
            come to South America with very high
            expectations.&quot; Both Barichello and rookie <b>Jan
            Magnussen</b> will be trying to keep up with the
            Jordans in their <b>SF1</b>&#146;s but should have no
            trouble staying ahead of the <b>Lola</b>&#146;s
            who&#146;s dire form in Melbourne prevented them from
            setting times within the 107% qualifying rule. Things
            don&#146;t look set to change until their new engine
            comes on line for <b>Spa</b> but the teams presence
            in South America is important, as funding is provided
            by the Brazilian arm of finance giant <b>MasterCard</b>.
            <b>Eric Broadley</b> Lola&#146;s boss said, &quot; We
            are treating it as a test session.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both <b>Olivier Panis</b>
            and <b>Shinji Nakano</b> finished extremely well as
            did <b>Jarno</b> <b>Trulli</b> in the vastly improved<b>
            Minardi Hart</b>. It seems though that Stalwart
            campaigner <b>Ken Tyrell</b> will see little
            improvement from running last years specification <b>Ford</b>
            engine.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This could be then,
            the true indication of the direction in which points
            will go. If, as is commonly believed, the Williams
            trounce all and sundry the probability is, that
            McLaren and Ferrari will enter the fray as secondary
            contenders. Provided that the set up problems of
            Benetton have been ironed out we should expect to See
            Berger qualifying on the second or third row also and
            the third step which now has to be the holy grail of
            all contending drivers, seeing as the first two are
            spoken for, could be his for the taking. Hill will
            have no expectations. Qualification should be easier
            here but as Irvine reckons quite reasonably &#145;he
            wont be higher than fifteenth&#146;. Irvine has
            forgotten Hill&#146;s knack of shaking the daylights
            out of a car and giving it a good kick in the pants
            to push it to its limit as we all saw in Melbourne.
            Hill I am sure will do all this and if Tom Walkinshaw
            who admitted &#145;screwing up&#146; in Australia
            gets it together for the champ, his ride might not be
            quite so rough as everyone expects. But, don&#146;t
            hold your breath.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is the start of
            the Grand Prix season proper where all the cars will
            begin to reveal themselves and the drivers, getting
            used to the body jarring bumps at Interlagos, will be
            hoping that their cars will stay in one piece long
            enough to get over the line and before they
            themselves expire through physical exhaustion. This
            is a race about the survival of the fittest both in
            man and machinery, but if the rains come, and storms
            are forecast for race weekend, then all bets are off
            and you may even see the Minardis taking a brief
            spell in the spotlight. No matter what the weather
            the spirit of &#145;carnival&#146; will be briefly
            re-ignited and irrespective of the outcome Brazil
            will have their talking points for the rest of the
            year.</font></p>
