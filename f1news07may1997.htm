            size="3" face="Arial"><b>he majority of Formula 1
            engine development work is carried out on the test
            bench. Certain aspects of the work, however, can only
            be done at the race track. Track test engineer Axel
            Plasse, who works out of Renault Sport's Development
            Department, talks about the importance of track
            testing in the course of a Formula 1 season and
            explains how his work complements bench testing.</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Why is track
            testing indispensable?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Generally
            speaking, testing is a means of validating a new
            development or a new component. It is an
            indispensable phase of the development process and
            rare indeed are the fields of technology in which
            engineers can allow themselves not to test.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Despite the
            importance of calculation work both within teams and
            at Renault Sport, nothing can replace testing. To be
            able to predict on paper what is likely to work and
            what isn't has effectively become increasingly
            important, but testing is still essential.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>What additional
            information does track testing provide you with?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Although
            bench testing attempts to reproduce real conditions
            as closely as possible, it has its limits. A Formula
            1 car moves, turns and accelerates whereas an engine
            on the bench is fixed which means that a whole host
            of situations can not simulated.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Having said
            that, the test bench remains a rigorous tool which is
            capable of determining, for example, whether a
            particular engine is developing, say, three
            brake-horsepower more than another unit. This is
            something which a driver is incapable of doing.
            However, a test bench is a bit like a computer
            inasmuch as it can only quantify parameters that are
            quantifiable. Some parameters - such as the
            characteristics of a new type of fuel - are difficult
            to put into figures in order to evaluate performance
            gains. On the other hand, there are many subjective
            considerations - such as driveability and response -
            which can only be judged by a driver. Track testing
            is an intermediate phase between bench testing and
            race use.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The work of your
            team is twofold. On the one hand you validate engine
            developments from the technical viewpoint and, on the
            other, you take on board the reactions of drivers
            with a view to improving driveability...</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Renault
            Sport's policy effectively covers two areas. First of
            all there is the quest for engine reliability, the
            final phase of which is validation on the race track.
            All new components brought must be validated in this
            way before they can find their way on to race
            engines. Reliable engines ensure that future
            development work is coherent and linear.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Renault Sport
            also attaches significant importance to driveability
            and driver comfort. We are not obsessed with engine
            power. We endeavour to produce an engine which is
            driveable in all conditions and which gives drivers
            no reason for complaint. Our aim is in fact to
            produce an engine which drivers can forget all about.
            It is often said that an engine on its own cannot win
            a race, but that it can lose one. An engine which
            puts out 10 or 20 extra horsepower will not change a
            car's overall competitiveness. However an engine
            which fails does. Track testing is essential for all
            the considerations which are related to driver
            comfort and driveability.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Can successful
            bench tests sometimes be rejected following track
            testing?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;There are
            certain types of modifications which we know in
            advance will benefit performance and which will have
            no adverse effect on driveability. A component which
            produces less friction, for example. These are
            systematically homologated...if, of course, they are
            reliable. However, it has been known for
            bench-validated evolutions which can potentially
            effect driveability to be dropped because the drivers
            weren't happy with them.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>How do you organise
            your work once the season is under way?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Track testing
            is the final link in the chain before a part or a new
            development can be raced. My job is to provide the
            race team with a perfectly finished product and team
            work is essential. During the season, private testing
            and races alternate. Test programmes tend to follow
            either long or short cycles with certain targets
            based on a time scale of perhaps one, two or three
            months, while other developments need to be validated
            in time for the following Grand Prix. Engine
            development accounts for around two-thirds of our
            work. The other third concerns problems encountered
            at the previous race. These are communicated to us
            once the race team gets back from the Grand Prix
            which means that our exact test job-list is only
            finalised at a very late stage.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;I get my
            satisfaction from hearing race engineers tell me that
            their engines functioned well over the Grand Prix
            weekend. That's when I feel that our job has been
            done correctly.&quot;</i></font></p>

            opinion is the best circuit for testing purposes?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Estoril. It
            includes some very slow portions, including the
            chicane where engine speeds fall to as low as 4,000
            rpm, which is pretty much an extreme case. Then there
            are the straights and some fast, 220-240 kph corners.
            It's an interesting circuit. The weather is generally
            fine and rain is quite rare.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Having said
            that, it is important to test at a variety of
            circuits. An engine needs to be put through its paces
            at all engine speeds to be sure that it will be
            reliable at all venues.&quot; </i></font></p>

            However, rumours that he will quit Formula 1 at the
            end of the season are unfounded especially in the
            light of his recent signing with Williams for a
            further year. Prompted by the implementation of new
            technical regulations regarding grooved tyres and a
            narrower track width on 1998 cars he said, <i>&quot;If
            it becomes boring to drive, then the pinnacle of
            racing will end up being in Indycars, and it could

            said. <i>&quot;I'm racing because I enjoy it and I

            track at <b>Fiorano</b> and continue to break the

            Wednesday, carrying out set-up work on the F 310B
            fitted with the 046/2 engine, Schumacher today went
            even quicker, stopping the clock in a time of
            59.007s. The German driver continued work on finding
            the best set-up for the Monaco Grand Prix, trying
            different aerodynamic downforce and brake settings.
            Schumacher divided the programme into a series of
            runs, stopping for between 20 and 25 minutes to make
            changes to the car, which was fitted with the 046/1
            engine. Earlier testing was done with the 046/step2
            engine in order to compare the two power units. <i>&quot;I

            driver <b>Gerhard Berger</b>. Criticising increased
            commercial and technical pressures since his F1 debut
            in the Austrian Grand Prix in 1984 <i>&quot;everybody
            puts themselves under more pressure: the drivers,

            &quot;It can&#146;t be healthy, doing it to be more
            efficient, to make more money. It's more material

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Looking back over his
            career, he lamented the events in1994 in which his

            and it was fitting that he should be celebrating his
            bi-centennial at Imola. <i>&quot;I have led here, had
            poles here, and had big accidents here. Obviously, we

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Team-mate Jean Alesi
            almost as long in the business, presented Berger with
            a specially commissioned crash helmet, painted half
            in his own colours and half in the Austrian's, as a
            memento of their time together both at Ferrari and at

            some homework</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>(</i>April 29th
            1997) It has been officially confirmed that <b>Adrian
            Newey</b> will be joining the <b>West McLaren
            Mercedes</b> team on August 1st as technical
            director, although it is thought by some, that his
            appointment has come too late for him to play a
            significant role in the design of next year's car.
            Boss <b>Ron Dennis</b> none the less, hinted that,
            despite new regulations and a two month testing ban
            after the last race in <b>Estoril</b>, there would be
            time to evolve a car that had Newey&#146;s imprint on
            it. <i>&quot;We have always produced our car quite
            late and the company is geared up for that. We intend
            to use all the resources available to us in the best
            possible way.&quot; </i>He said. Again, hinting at
            his determination to get Newey integrated into the
            team as quickly as possible, he continued, <i>&quot;It
            is unlikely that we will turn up (at the first race)
            having never turned a wheel on a new car, but if that
            was the best way to do it, we would do it.&quot;</i>
            It is thought that the design process could already
            have begun at Newey&#146;s home in Oxforshire,
            digital data being easily transferable at any time,
            to the team&#146;s headquarters in Woking.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Newey had been
            prevented from joining McLaren for the last six
            months by ex-boss <b>Frank Williams</b>, for whom he
            worked as Chief Designer for seven years, helping him
            in no small way to three driver&#146;s crowns and
            four Constructors cups. Dennis stressed that Newey's
            appointment would not jeopardise relations with the
            Williams team. <i>&quot;Our friendship and sharing
            each others' views on every subject has strengthened
            in the last four months.&quot; </i>he said, referring
            to a united struggle with the FIA, for re-admittance
            to the &#145;Concord Agreement&#146;, &quot;<i>There
            remains total harmony between our companies.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With rumours abounding
            that Damon Hill has been seen in close conversation
            with Dennis, the addition of Newey, Hills close ally
            at Williams, could signal a change of seats for the
            current World Champion for next year. <b><i>(see

            Nakano has accepted that his performances have not
