        <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>Team solidarity and
        performance are key parts to the success of any area of a
        Formula One team. But none more so than in the process of
        designing, developing and constructing the race car
        itself.</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is a paramount
        process and Operations Director <b>Joan Villadelprat</b>
        is quick to acknowledge that teamwork plays an intrinsic
        role as the car takes to life from computer screen to
        race track.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;It is everything
        really, he confirms. Each area is worked specifically by
        certain people and they all need to gel together. You
        have people working on composite, machinery, fabrication,
        assembly -from people putting the car together to the
        painter. It is a team effort all the way.&quot;</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i></i></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Joan estimates the birth
        of a Formula One car takes 'normally' up to five months
        and as the car begins to reach the final product, the
        team members involved, simultaneously increase.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Firstly it starts
        off at the drawing office and then production gets
        involved and then everyone gets involved, so the whole
        company works towards the same end,&quot;</i> he
        explains. <i>&quot;You probably have 30 people to start
        with, then you end up with about 110, and then by the end
        you have everyone else.&quot;</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i></i></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A long and exacting
        process, the advent of new rules and regulations with
        increasing competition does not just have its affects in
        the heat of the race, but also in the walls of the team
        factory, as Joan highlights the one piece of machinery
        which is attributed most time on.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;We have some new
        systems in the B197 this year. Power steering is one of
        many new items we have never had in the car before and
        the implementation of these needs to be included in the
        schedule which you try to stick to.&quot;</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;From our side,
        because we do not produce the engine, the gearbox the
        gearbox takes the longest to make. It takes four and a
        haklf months and you have a dedicated group of people
        working on it. At the end of the day when the chassis is
        done it takes very little time, but the gearbox is a
        delicate part.</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;First you have to
        do the design and then patterns before the castings are
        done. These have to be confirmed and then you need to
        machine the castings, do the internal arrangements, so it
        is quite a big job.&quot;</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i></i></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">And mistakes.... <i>&quot;Mistakes
        at the different stages get caught in the methods and
        systems we have in the company. From the inspection
        department to quality control.&quot;</i></font></p>
