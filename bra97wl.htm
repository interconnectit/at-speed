            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The Winners:</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Prost GP and
            Bridgestone:</u> Well. How about that? A car that was
            thought to be a flash in the Monte Carlo pan has
            outright and in very normal circumstances, come an
            extremely good third. The soft Bridgestone tyres
            carried him to the finish, on the same lap as
            Villeneuve and without a scratch. Le Professeur
            mustn't be able to believe his luck as the points
            start rolling in and he is ahead of his old team,
            Williams-Renault in the standings. They went about
            their business quietly and extraordinarily
            effectively and one of the most under-rated - or is
            that ignored? - driver in the championship drove a
            careful and smart race. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Damon Hill:</u>
            Yes, he's still a winner. He must have been going
            right off (<i>Australian colloquial expression
            meaning &quot;Trying rather hard&quot;) </i>in that
            cockpit. He has narrowed the gap between the
            Arrows-Pig and the No. 3 Williams-Renault of his
            former team-mate to far less than two seconds and had
            the thing up to fourth at one stage. His replacement
            at Williams did no better than that. For that car to
            run in the points is a major achievement by any
            driver, and Mr Diniz is not doing too badly either
            with his comparatively modest talents. Of course, the
            Yamaha V10 had the last say.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Jacques Villeneuve:</u>
            Not so much a winner (for the purposes of this
            article anyway) as a damn lucky boy. He fluffed it in
            much the same way as he did in Melbourne, trying to
            play the hard man and off he went into the gravel.
            Cleverly, someone behind him decided that a Grand
            Prix is not complete without a first-corner accident.
            Although Villeneuve rejoined with a screaming
            foot-to-the-floor run through the gravel, all in one
            piece and not too far back, it helped that most of
            the cars were still negotiating the new chicane at
            the Senna Ess not put there by the safety committee.
            The restart must have been like a two-year contract
            from Renault, sorry, Mechachrome, falling from the
            sky.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Everyone (apart
            from Villeneuve) who qualified in front of Frentzen:</u>
            Figure out for yourself why these people are winners.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The Losers: </b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Heinz-Harald
            Frentzen:</u> I have a horrid feeling he's going to
            be a regular in the losers section. He did his Friday
            trick of being fastest and then got walloped by
            Villeneuve in the Saturday qualifying. He was
            outqualified by much lesser machines and people who
            are allegedly lesser drivers. He did nothing, and I
            mean <b><u>NOTHING!!!!</u></b> in the race, didn't
            even improve or hold his qualifying place. I find it
            difficult to believe that Frank and Patrick are
            throwing all their support behind Mr Frentzen as he
            is not making use of the equipment with which he has
            been supplied. It was a very ordinary performance and
            Damon Hill's 1995 season must be looking mighty good
            in comparison. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Michael Schumacher:
            </u>On second thoughts, anyone earning that kind of
            money is not a loser. Make him a winner.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Frank Williams and
            Patrick Head:</u> Losers in the sense that they
            signed Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a time when they were
            not supporting Damon Hill as their best driver and
            not treating either of their drivers with the respect
            they deserved but expecting them both to win races
            while their technical director went to a Touring Car
            race. The Williams lawyer must already be hard at
            work trying to find a clause in the contract that
            reads 'sacking useless driver because we thought he'd
            be better than Damon Hill, but he wasn't.' I hope for
            all their sakes that Frentzen pulls his finger out.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Viewers of the ITV
            coverage: </u>Murray sounded like he was bellowing
            into a dodgy mobile phone on a tube station platform,
            Louise was lost completely and Martin sounded more
            nasal than I can ever recall. The pictures, though no
            fault of ITV, were awful and it looked like one of
            the cameras was being run by a cross-eyed kid from an
            adjoining favela. The biggest losers were those
            watching the same coverage in Australia who had to
            put up with Alan Jones and Dazza (see Postcard from
            Melbourne) trying to pad out the time before the
            restart and when we lost Louise. It was 3am, I was
            tired, the TV had to be turned down low so as not to
            wake the rest of the house and I was not in the mood
            for that stupidity. We didn't even see the champagne.
            Dazza lied and said they'd lost the satellite, when
            in actual fact there was something more important on.
            A <i>General Hospital</i> episode that was about
            fifteen years old, or some such terror.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Yamaha:</u> They
            get a world champion on board and give him a portable
            hand grenade.</font></p>

            designed the Arrows throttle system: </u>Tom must be
            making this guy's life a living hell. </font></p>
