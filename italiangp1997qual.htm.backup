            with a glorious 1m 23.06s and despite improving yet
            again to his final best of 1m 23.066s was unable to
            attain the spot that he has coveted since his
            magnificent second place at <i>Spa</i>. Having been
            called to the stewards for failing to observe the
            waved yellow flag after <b>Jarno Trulli</b> spun off,
            his lap times for that run were disallowed and he was
            given a one race suspended ban for the rest of the
            season. However since his fastest time today was made
            on his penultimate laps (the run after the one
            disallowed) his qualifying position was not affected.
            <i>&quot;It is a wonderful position for me to be in
            for my first F1 race at Monza&quot;</i> Said a
            delighted Fisichella. <i>&quot;I hope to end up in
            the top three in the race as well. I feel optimistic
            and know that we have a good race set up following
            testing here last week. I hope I have given something
            to the fans today and that I can do the same
            tomorrow.&quot; </i>Team mate </font><a

            Experiencing the same problems that have beset
            Ferrari during the middle half of the season. the
            German was probably not very surprised, as his
            testing session at <i>Monza</i> had been
            disappointing also. <i>&quot;Naturally I am
            disappointed with today's qualifying when I just
            could not do better.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;I
            think the problem is that the moment the track
            temperature goes up, our tyres overheat, so they do
            not work properly and they lose grip. I said last
            week in testing that it would be difficult for us to
            get a good grid position at Monza. With so many
            competitive cars on the grid, a few tenths of a
            second costs you a lot of places on the grid. We have
            to accept that, but tomorrow I will do my best to
            make the most of the situation.&quot;</i></font></p>

            lost it. His only other pole being with the <i>Scuderia</i>
            at the same circuit three years ago. <i>&quot;Everything
            has gone as perfectly as I could have hoped and it
            has followed on from our good test here last
            week.&quot;</i> Said a delighted Alesi <i>&quot;Our
            car is very competitive with a full fuel load, so if
            I get a good start, I have a good chance. It&#146;s a
