            difference to the race outcome of the <b>San Marino
            Grand Prix</b> at <b>Imola</b>. It was really a
            matter of which of the two <b>Williams</b> drivers
            would cross the line first. A wet warm up session in
            the morning gave the baying<i> tifosi</i> a glimmer
            of hope in seeing their beloved red cars trounce the
            opposition and, it nearly came to pass, opposition
            not being trounced, but, one might say, closely
            monitored as one Williams gave up the ghost and the
            other, taking the flag a length or so in front of
            second place man and local hero, <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b>.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On a drying track
            warmed by a pastel sun behind high hazy clouds, the
            race got underway with an incident free start for the
            first time this year. The first three cars made an
            equally lightning getaway leaving Villeneuve in the
            lead, but wobbling on his brakes into the first turn
            fending off Schumacher who had slipped passed <b>Heinz
            Harald Frentzen</b> on the line. <b>Olivier Panis</b>
            in the <b>Bridgestone</b>-shod <b>Prost Mugen Honda</b>
            was caught on the grid by both <b>Johnny Herbert</b>
            in the <b>Sauber Petronas</b> and <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>&#146;s
            <b>Jordan Peugeot</b>, who proceeded to attack the
            already widening gap between himself and the 3rd
            placed Williams.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One driver who was
            probably wishing that the heavens would open and wash
            him away, was World Champion <b>Damon Hill</b> who
            made an inauspicious exit from the pitlane in the
            spare car under the guise of having his settings
            changed for wet weather. It was later revealed that
            this rather feeble excuse covered up yet another
            mechanical fault in the <b>Arrows A18</b> and another
            blunder by the <b>TWR </b>team in the shape of a
            starter motor shaft oil seal failure. Hill&#146;s
            race was run before he hit the track, but hit it he
            did, charging from the pit lane in futile pursuit of
            last man <b>Ukyo Katayama</b>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Villeneuve proceeded
            to open up a huge gap, reeling of a succession of
            fastest laps, leaving a frustrated Frentzen in the
            wake of the slower Ferrari and desperately seeking a
            way round. Schumacher Jnr was unable to match the
            pace of the top three but was keeping Herbert and
            Panis under a tight leash setting the tempo for the
            crocodile of cars behind.</font></p>

        </font><font size="1" face="Arial">Hill's day finished
        early following a frustrating mechanical failure.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill&#146;s fateful
            day came to an untimely conclusion when,
            understandably frustrated by earlier events and the
            uncompromising nature of the circuit, he took a long
            dive at <b>Shinji Nokano</b>&#146;s Prost on the
            entry to the <b><i>Variente Bassa </i></b>complex.
            The inevitable collision occurred, Hill losing his
            front wheel and sending the talentless Japanese
            spinning into the dirt. <i>&quot;I touched him
            alright, in fact I T-boned him,&quot;</i> said an
            uncharacteristically darkly-humoured Hill after the
            race, <i>&quot;I thought it was ambitious, yes, but I
            wasn&#146;t going to tag around at the back of the
            field. I caught him up, as I was 3 secs a lap
            quicker. He blocked me for a lap and to be honest, I
            was pretty cheesed off after starting in the pit
            lane. The move was only on if he let me through...but
            he didn&#146;t. You don&#146;t enjoy being held up by
            people who shouldn&#146;t be holding you up. </i>For
            the first time this season, he let go at the team,
            &quot;<i>We&#146;ve got to get our act
            together,&quot;</i> he said, <i>&quot;We have not had
            one race meeting yet where I have not sprung an oil
            leak either on the grid or in the pits.&quot; </i>It
            was quite clear that Hill was getting to the end of
            his tether and the racing driver in him was just
            itching to get out. The blame for the incident could
            not really be laid fully at Nakano&#146;s feet. <i>&quot;Hill
            just ran into me from behind at the last
            chicane.&quot;</i> Calling Hill <i>&#145;Mr World
            Champion&#146;</i>, he explained,<i> &quot;I saw him
            in my mirrors but, as I turned in, he hit the rear
            left of my car hard.&quot;</i> Being realistic, the
            chance of a major points loss caused by this incident
            however, seemed slim indeed. To add to his wretched
            weekend, Hill was given a suspended one race ban by
            the stewards who had no doubts at all as to where the
            blame lay. His team-mate <b>Pedro Diniz</b> collected
            a similar prize for causing a near miss with Jacques
            Villeneuve. In addition to taking his driver out,
            Hill may have brought back grim memories for team
            boss <b>Alain Prost </b>who on several occasions in
            his own career, must have suffered the same
            frustrations.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A series of
            retirements before the first round of stops changed
            the order of the mid runners, when Ralf Schumacher
            after a superb drive, retired with a broken drive
            shaft handing fourth place to Herbert who, coasting
            to a standstill with an electrical fault moments
            later, handed <i>his</i> place to Irvine. Panis by
            this time had dropped back down the line clearly
            struggling with his Bridgestone tyres, the
            infallibility of which up until this point, had been
            legendary. This could be portentous for the Japanese
            manufacturer and the chink in their armour that <b>Goodyear</b>
            were looking for. Nil points for Olivier this time.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the time Schumacher
            made his first pit stop on Lap 24, Frentzen was
            buzzing around his exhaust like an angry bee and,
            using the clear air, he put in two truly electrifying
            laps while his team-mate stopped for tyres also.
            Those vital seconds gained, combined with
            Villeneuve&#146;s out lap being hampered by traffic,
            enabled him to retain his lead and he started pulling
            away at the rate of over a second a lap. Tables were
            now turned for the Williams boys and, about time.
            Indeed Villeneuve seemed to be having trouble hanging
            on to Schumacher and it looked at one point that he
            would be swallowed up by the McLaren of <b>David
            Coulthard</b> who, on a 1 stop strategy was light on
            fuel and moving very quickly.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Retirement for <b>Rubens
            Barrichello</b> came with a loss of oil pressure
            after a solid drive in 8th and proving to be the
            better of the Bridgestone runners. This makes the
            second retirement in a row for the <b>Stewart Ford</b>
            team.<i>&quot; We have had a troubled weekend and
            we&#146;ve just got to see what we can do about
            it.&quot;</i> commented Jackie Stewart afterwards. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The gaggle of
            mid-placed cars were still trying to make a race of
            it 27 second behind the race leaders. Making things
            worse, was <b>Ukyo Katayama</b> thinking that Sundays
            were for driving slow and looking at the scenery and
            not in ones mirrors. Had he done so, he would have
            seen not only Coulthard bearing down on him but
            Irvine, <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b>, desperate to
            prove a point to his departed and unmissed team-mate
            Schumacher, and Panis. A fine spray of oil was now
            emanating from the back of Coulthard&#146;s McLaren
            and undoubtedly this gave Fisichella the opportunity
            to make a daring move past Irvine&#146;s momentarily
            sliding Ferrari, only to have his visor splattered
            with oil seconds later, as the <b>McLaren Mercedes</b>,
            exploded in a billow of white smoke.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was now obvious
            that Villeneuve was in trouble and after a prolonged
            pit stop on lap 42, where a desperate attempt to fit
            a new steering wheel and get the jammed gearbox into
            neutral met without success after two full minutes,
            the car was wheeled into the garage, a bitterly
            disappointed Canadian still strapped tightly in his
            cockpit. <i>&quot;The car was strong all weekend and
            it is a great disappointment.&quot;</i> Villeneuve
            said, <i>&quot;The gears wouldn&#146;t change down,
            but then I got on the straight, accelerated and it
            would change down by itself, so I lost control of the
            gears. It&#146;s impossible to drive like that.&quot;</i>
            Frentzen responded to the demise of his team mate
            with a fastest lap, handing the lead briefly to
            Schumacher when he made his final pit stop.
            Schumacher couldn&#146;t hold onto it, being forced
            to brake heavily by a wayward <b>Nicola Larini</b>
            and then having to follow him into the pits, losing
            valuable time in the process. The position was not to
            change. Irvine having regained his place over
            Fisichella by way of a timely pitstop and inheriting
            Villeneuve&#146;s space, found himself in third,
            albeit 18 seconds down with an easy cruise to the
            second podium finish in a row. <i>&quot;I had a good
            idea he (Fisichella) had more fuel onboard so I could
            go longer in the 2nd stint and I was able to overtake
            him in the pits.&quot;</i> Said Irvine, clearly
            unfazed by the result, &quot;<i>After the 2nd pit
            stop it was quite boring, plodding along to the
            finish. It&#146;s nice to be back on the podium, but
            it didn&#146;t give me the same buzz as two weeks
            ago.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the rain started to
            spot the drivers mirrors, Heinz Harald Frentzen
            crossed the line to take the flag hotly pursued in
            the latter stages by Schumacher who followed,
            breathing down his neck 1.2 seconds behind. <i>&quot;The
            car was working fairly well and I was basically
            happy. Second is more than I expected.&quot; </i>Said
            a delighted Schumacher, <i>&quot; We are the only
            team that can go at almost the speed of the Williams
            and certain changes in our car soon, may give us the
            step up we are looking for.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Oddly enough the
            Italians got what they wanted by seeing two thirds of
            the podium covered in red and indeed Fans crossing
            the borders to see new German hero Frentzen make
            good, got a double Teutonic helping, it being a first
            in Grand Prix history. Schumacher also promised <i>&#145;more
            German dominance&#146;</i> to come and one can only
            surmise what will happen when younger brother Ralf,
            throws his towel on the top step of the podium. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Frentzen of course was
            delighted and, initially lost for words but
            eventually his faltering English never sounded so
            eloquent, <i>&quot;It&#146;s very much like....oil on
            my soul. I put in two quick laps before my pit stop
            and gained about 2 seconds and when I came out and
            saw P1, I was absolutely pleased and surprised. I was
            concerned about the brakes, I didn&#146;t want to
            happen again what happened in Melbourne. I had to
            push but I didn&#146;t brake as much as I could have
            done. I tried to save more brakes at the end.&quot;</i>
            Williams Boss, <b>Frank Williams, </b>allowing the
            Formula 1 fraternity a rare smile, was not
            advertising his vindication in his decision to
            replace Hill with the young German. He said, <i>&quot;He
            was concerned about his brakes, but they were fine
            and we were telling him to go quicker, but, he was in
            control.&quot;</i> Fully aware of the increased
            pressure this will now put on him to continue his
            success rather than to achieve it for the first time,
            Frentzen stated earlier that he &#145;become the prey
            instead of being the hunter&#146;. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But, despite his
            undeniably dazzling win, a shadow of doubt must still
            remain as to Frentzen&#146;s consistent race winning
            capabilities. With the real yard stick having retired
            and his fellow countryman driving a car lacking the
            outright speed of the Williams, yet finishing less
            than a second and a half behind, the German has, for
            the time being at least, still to be the hunter and
            win, against the only man that is capable at this
            moment, of going faster.</font></p>
