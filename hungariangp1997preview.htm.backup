            him, but he will undoubtedly have his private
            thoughts for this coming weekend. For, here last
            year, was where he tied up the Constructors
            championship title with a definitive 1, 2 win, his
            two drivers crossing the line barely three quarters
            of a second apart, a massive 141 points accrued for
            the team. The drivers shared victories in 9 out of
            the 11 races contested so far, and at the same time
            equalled the points record previously set by </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial">. Perhaps more to the point,
            was that a Williams driver also occupied the lower
            steps of the podium on 6 occasions, 5 of them second
            places. The strength of the Williams cars was obvious
            but few seemed to acknowledge the support that the
            two drivers maintained for the team and the
            consummate skills required to stay in such close
            proximity to each other throughout the season. </font></p>

            first year of F1, learning the tracks and driving out
            of his skin and <b>Damon Hill</b>, as seems to be his
            personal cross to bear, suffering the slings and
            arrows from the press and his team boss for any small
            lapse of concentration or purpose were, in hindsight,
            the dream team. Even the great <b>Michael Schumacher</b>
            could not have amassed all those points single
            handedly (<b>Eddie Irvine</b> at best last year, was
            an encumbrance) and even with the second best current
            driver in the world <i>(who? Hill? Villeneuve? Alesi?
            Berger?)</i>, the points position after the eleventh
            race of the season, probably would not have been a
            great deal different.</font></p>

            it would only bring their tally to 91
            constructor&#146;s points, 50 less than last year and
            had Ferrari not suffered a major hiccup at the <i>British
            Grand Prix</i>, it would be less. The Wisdom of Frank
            William&#146;s choice of second driver now must seem
            suspect to one and all, yet we all know that he is a
            man, like <b>Eddie Jordan</b>, of rare vision and it
            is seldom that he gets things so wrong. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is unquestionable
            that Frentzen is quick, even the lowly punter can see
            his potential, but is it all a bit too early? Can </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial">afford to wait until Frentzen
            blooms into bud and starts filling the pits with the
            rich perfume of success? Frank will be a brave man to
            keep the young German on for a second year, but the
            feeling is that he must, if only to protect his
            investment. To fatten Frentzen&#146;s skills up this
            season and then release him to another team would be
            unwise, yet the acid test will come, if he is kept
            on, next season. If he doesn&#146;t make good, then
            Williams has saddled himself with a slow horse for
            the whole season. It is also important for the team
            to groom a German for championship status, as the
            rumours of a tie up with BMW, make the inclusion of a
            German in their driver package a sound business deal
            as well. But then with Michael Schumacher free from
            his </font><a
            href="http://www.at-speed.co.uk/smn/fe97sp.htm"><font
            size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Ferrari</strong></font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial"> contract at the end of next
            year, who knows how many noughts Frank might be
            prepared to put on his cheque? Realistically, he has
            only Villeneuve to rely on this season to grab the
            driver&#146;s title, as even he must see that the
            constructors crown is slipping away and unless
            Frentzen suddenly picks up some form, the Canadian
            cannot do it on his own.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Going by
            Frentzen&#146;s form in the last two races, he would
            do well to stay out of second slot on the grid. By
            getting the &#145;dirty&#146; side of the track his
            attack for the front could be fraught with danger. A
            fast acceleration along the pit straight to the first
            180 degree blind corner will demand heavy braking and
            the avoidance of other moving objects is of paramount
            importance.</font></p>

            size="2" face="Arial">Technical director, says of the
            circuit, <i>&quot;You will see clouds of dust at the
            beginning of every session. The conditions can change
            constantly according to the amount of dust carried on
            to the track by the wind, by cars going off or
            support vehicles.&quot;</i> He also commented on the
            pressures of fitting in a good lap whilst waiting for
            the track to clean itself. <i>&quot;There is a
            notable reluctance on everyone&#146;s part to be
            first out on the circuit and clean it up for
            everybody else, which often makes for a very quiet
            first part of the practice sessions.&quot;</i> He
            said. &quot;<i>As yet Formula 1 has not established a
            procedure stating who should clean the track for the
            others! Schumacher thanked Rubens Barichello for
            doing that in Canada but I don&#146;t imagine we can
            expect him to return the compliment in
            Budapest!.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <i>Hungaroring</i>
            is a slow circuit with straight line speeds slower
            than Monaco and an average speed only a little
            higher. It is also a high downforce circuit and with
            16 corners, good lap times are not easy.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Built in 1984 and host
            to the first ever Formula 1 Grand Prix in an Iron
            Curtain country, the <i>Hungaroring </i>in 1986, saw
            one of the largest ever crowds at an F1 event in that
            opening year. Over 200,000 eager fans saw <b>Nelson
            Piquet </b>take the chequered flag for the first time
            in a championship race in the Eastern Bloc. The race
            being unexpectedly slow, was curtailed after the two
            hour time limit expired, a lap short of the scheduled
            77.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Motor racing in
            Hungary dates back to 1936 when the Budapest GP was
            held in <i>Nepliget Park </i>over a 5 Km figure of
            eight circuit. It was won by <b>Nuvolari</b> driving
            a Ferrari entered <b>Alfa Romeo</b>. The war years
            provided spasmodic racing and it was only in the
            1960&#146;s after Budapest&#146;s airport at <i>Ferihegy</i>
            was used for Formula Junior, that European Touring
            car championship events were held on a modified
            version of the park in the centre of the city. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <i>Hungaroring</i>
            was a brand new track built in a natural bowl and
            designed to give spectators maximum viewing. It has
            an almost oval infield and a multi cornered outfield
            taking it into the <i>Harmas Forrest</i> close by the
            village of Mogyorod about 12 miles North East of the
            city. Only one small alteration has been made since
            it&#146;s construction, bridging the original
            downhill chicane after turn two behind the paddocks.
            Put there originally to by-pass a previously
            undetected underground spring, the unpopular chicane
            was straightened to provide the only fast section of
            the circuit. Nigel Mansell&#146;s 1992 World
            Championship was decided here and Damon Hill won his
            first Grand Prix in 1993. <i>&quot;The city of
            Budapest has a special atmosphere, and the atmosphere
            of the circuit is also very pleasant,&quot;</i> said
            Michael Schumacher and, sounding a bit like the elder
            statesman of F1, he added <i>&quot;With the public
            sitting on the grass, it reminds me of the old days
            in racing.&quot; </i>Well, pass me the <em>Ovaltine</em>
            and the <em>Daily Sketch</em>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The race is usually
            one of the less exciting moments of the season,
            processional out of necessity, as there are so few
            passing places. </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jordan</b></font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial">&#146;s <b>Gary Anderson</b>
            explains, <i>&quot;There are 16 corners per lap and
            the drivers will need to get a rhythm going and learn
            to drive their cars smoothly through theses corners.
            It is also impossible to overtake and this, plus the
            fact that tyre wear will create the need for more pit
            stops than usual, makes race strategy in Hungary
            crucial.&quot;</i> In fact the last three Grands Prix
            have been won by drivers on three stop strategies. <b>Eghbal
            Hamidy</b> Aerodynamicist with </font><a

            size="2" face="Arial">Stewart</font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial"> thinks otherwise:<i>
            &quot;Tyre wear here is generally very low, which
            means a probable one stop strategy for most teams. If
            you plan just one, you minimise your chances of
            losing time in traffic.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This leads one to
            surmise therefore that the top four teams will
            probably go for more stops than the lower half of the
            grid, as their power advantage will take them more
            easily through the slower back-markers. It will be
            interesting to see where <b>Rubins Barichello</b> and
            <b>Jan Magnussen</b> are, half way through the race.
            The fact that the lower half of the grid contain all
            the <b>Bridgestone</b> runners, may prove eventful
            and with a reputation for keeping their tyres going
            longer, we may indeed see the <b>Goodyear</b> shod
            cars stopping three times out of necessity. </font></p>

            was Schumacher rather than the car, that won them the

            comeback a fortnight ago must surely have sparked a

            maintain such indomitable form, yet a higher placing
            than of late could be on the cards. </font></p>

            because the absence of long straights means that you
            never have a chance to relax.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of the 572 points that
            the past 11 Hungarian Grands Prix have thrown up,
            Williams have taken 212, by far, the greatest points
            tally for this particular race. Whether they can add
            another 32 to that score remains to be seen, but if
            the new improved and leaner Ferrari grabs that pole
            position, quite literally, it wont be seen for dust.</font></p>
