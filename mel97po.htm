        <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
            Australian Grand Prix was a corker, was it not?
            Channel 9 did their usual masterful job as host
            network and Australians can now resume the air of
            resignation foisted upon us by shoddy late night
            coverage.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Didn't
            Eddie Irvine spice things up nicely? We now had a
            spectacle on our hands as we realised Williams had
            once again fluffed it on strategy. Apart from the
            obvious (hiring Heinz-Harald Frentzen) they went for
            two stops instead of one, picked the <u>wrong</u>
            tyre and obviously picked the wrong brake disc. Back
            to the bad old days of 1995. I could just imagine
            Damon Hill popping his head out of the garage to give
            the Williams boys a smirk and a friendly wave. After
            all he wasn't expected to win like a Williams was.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
            winners of the weekend? Let's see. Damon Hill won the
            hearts of us all as he battled to get the
            Arrows-Yamaha pig on the grid. He wrestled, he
            raunched, he put up a damn good fight and won the
            war. At least the throttle stuck off rather than on
            during the warm-up lap. Then again, the Yamaha sucks,
            so maybe it didn't matter either way. David Coulthard
            gave the field a lesson in staying cool, calm and
            collected with a Ferrari in the mirrors and made
            everyone smile at the finish. And Jacques Villeneuve
            - boy, can he hustle. Apart from playing the hard-man
            at the start and handing Eddie the chance to help
            Herr Schumacher to the front, he did nothing wrong
            and has Heinz-Harald packing death. This, however,
            does not mean I like him!</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
            losers? Frentzen, Frentzen and Frentzen. He lost the
            mind battle with Villeneuve, lost the driver battle
            when he simply refused to pull his finger out and get
            that Williams roaring. Nobody, feels particularly
            sorry for him (except him) because he hardly went out
            in a blaze of glory. He just sputtered to a stop and
            had the added ignominy of some fluid spraying him as
            the car lay stricken in the kitty-litter. And
            finally, Frentzen. Williams are picking up where they
            left off in 1995 and just might manage to lose the
            constructor's championship with a driver who is being
            bullied quite comprehensively by his team-mate.
            Frentzen is an easy target as he is psychologically
            fragile compared to the 1996-model Damon Hill.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Actually,
            Jean Alesi is a big loser. I don't quite know how
            much of a loser Jean Alesi is (I reckon Flavio
            Briatore is very aware) but he must be his own worst
            enemy. He claimed he lost radio contact (despite the
            fact we saw him sitting talking to his pits when he
            finally cruised to a halt) and felt silly. I bet he
            felt sillier after Flavio was finished with him. The
            very fact that he ignored his pit-board (you know,
            the large black thing they hang over the side telling
            him <strong>IN</strong>.) What must the pit-board
            have said? &quot;Turn it up!&quot; or &quot;Why are
            you ignoring us you idiot?&quot; The body language of
            the pit crew said it all, although he probably didn't
            recognise who they were when he plucked up the
            courage to come back to the pits. &quot;Who are you
            again? Roger, is it?&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Could do
            better? Well, no-one <em>really</em>. The two new
            teams were poles <br>
            apart. Lola were abysmal (we won't say why, now, will
            we?) and Stewart highly impressive considering they
            had Ford works engines letting them down - where have
            we heard that before? Rubens Barrichello showed his
            usual early-season enthusiasm, but you know the old
            story. Once Jan gets up to speed (and he will), we'll
            see the sooky Rubens of old. Poor old Jos Verstappen
            (to quote Murray Walker) could always do better and
            Jordan-Peugeot are always first in line to receive
            the &quot;could-do-better&quot; talk. Never mind.
            Maybe one day.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">All in
            all, a great start to the season for Formula One.
            Some teams and drivers are not so happy, but I'm damn
            sure the punters were reasonably satisfied. It was a
            race and a good one at that and the sport has got to
            be happy with itself. Hopefully, when Jacques clears
            off into the distance (discounting Eddie's start-line
            antics) we'll be treated to the racing behind the
            Williams pair.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>What
            the papers said:</strong></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
            Sydney Morning Herald had a big front page colour
            photo of an airborne Jos Verstappen as well as a
            three photo series of Villeneuve and Herbert spinning
            into oblivion. A fairly average race report in the
            sport section completely failed to give Jean Alesi
            the bollocking he deserved. Kennedy's report was
            given generous space and gave the reader a good feel
            for the type of day it was.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
            Telegraph Mirror gave us a warm and fuzzy type
            report, the back page showing an elated Mika Hakkinen
            hoisting David Coulthard into the air. The report was
            average, again failing to hammer people who deserved
            it, barely even mentioning the disgrace that was TWR
            Arrows' performance, giving Damon Hill a completely
            dud car.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
            Australian (national) followed the SMH, front page
            and all. Same old same old with regard to the
            reports. Altogether nothing very special from the
            print media. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">TV made
            the usual balls-up. Stuffing up names, apportioning
            blame where it wasn't due, the whole bit. The usual
            cavalcade of glamorous, leggy and busty reporters who
            didn't know a lot, or tired old hacks staggering
            toward the end of their contract. Channel 10 was the
            usual saviour, both in the news bulletin and the
            nightly <em>Sports Tonight</em> program which had
            carried the passable Mika Hakkinen story in the
            lead-up to the race.</font></p>
