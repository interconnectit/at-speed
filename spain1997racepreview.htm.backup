            face="Arial"><b>Michael Schumacher</b> dislikes it,
            most drivers find it difficult and it takes it&#146;s
            toll on machinery of all kinds. Importantly, it has
            been the epicentre of testing both in and out of
            season for the majority of teams. Being in the deep
            south of Europe does not guarantee constant fine
            weather as last year revealed when most unexpectedly
            Schumacher driving what everyone thought to be a
            rather recalcitrant <b>Ferrari </b>through heavy
            rain, literally cruised to his first definitive
            victory for the <i>Scuderia, </i>a minute ahead of
            another great &#145;wet&#146; racer <b>Jean Alesi</b>.
            <i>&quot;I wouldn&#146;t have put a penny that I
            would win the race after qualifying and my results in
            Brazil</i> (3rd after qualifying 4th) <i>and Monaco </i>(spun
            off on the first lap).&quot; He said after the race. <i>&quot;The
            beginning of the race was a disaster but later I
            started to relax and feel comfortable and was
            overtaking my rivals by trying different lines. I was
            freezing cold in the car but we held on for that
            first win&quot;. </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One of the most
            advanced circuits that the Formula 1 circus visit, It
            is the curves and corners that set the <b><i>Circuit
            de Catalunya</i></b> apart from the others. With the
            exception of the new, remodelled <b><i>Osterreichring</i></b>,
            renamed as the <b><i>A-1 Ring</i></b> in Austria, the
            venue for the Spanish Grand Prix remains the most
            recent circuit to be added to the Formula 1 calendar.
            The track is extremely undulating, the curves are
            long, and sweep at a constant radius, which means
            that high levels of G-force are exerted on the
            drivers pushing their physical strength and stamina
            to the limit. More than half the corners are greater
            than 90 degrees.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Technical Director <b>Gary
            Anderson</b> of the <b>Jordan Peugeot</b> team says
            of Catalunya, <i>&quot;At a normal 90 degree corner
            balance is not crucial, as, by the time the driver is
            half way through the turn, he can see the exit and he
            is not trying to drive the car through the middle of
            the corner. The number of corners greater than 90
            degrees at Barcelona means balance is extremely
            important and specifically the need to keep the front
            end of the car pointing into the bend for a longer
            period. Cars have to have a very different set-up to
            that of the other circuits.&quot; </i>He continued <i>&quot;To
            get a good balance in these low speed corners, you
            are compromising traction and the driver is having to
            work with the car which would be a little
            &#145;pointy&#146; in fast 90 degree corners.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(Which could of course
            explain why Schumacher breezed it in the wet last
            year. With nothing to lose on the wet track, they
            decided to run with maximum downforce and extremely
            soft spring settings. The relatively slow speeds in
            the sharp corners was ideal, whilst not compromising
            an exceptional configuration for the fast 90 degree
            bends).</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Catalunya is the
            latest in a string of tracks that have at one time
            hosted the Spanish race, the first, held in 1913 over
            3 laps of a 90 Km circuit at <b><i>Guadarrama</i></b>
            was won by <b>Carlos de Salamanca</b>, driving a <b>Rolls
            Royce</b>. Various sites hosted the event. <b>Alberto
            Divo</b> won in 1923 in a <b>Sunbeam</b>, at the <b><i>Sitges-Terramar</i></b>
            Autodrome on the coast south of Barcelona and a year
            later <i>another</i> Sunbeam, driven by one <b>Harry
            Segrave</b> won on the <b><i>Lasarte</i></b> circuit
            near San Sebastion. The first World Championship
            event was held in 1951 on the <b><i>Pedralbes</i></b>
            street circuit on the outskirts of Barcelona. <b><i>Montjuich
            Park</i></b> in the centre of the city then followed,
            interspersed with races at <b><i>Jarama</i></b>.
            Finally <b><i>Jerez </i></b>succumbed to the new
            purpose built arena circuit of <b><i>Montmelo-Catalunya</i></b>
            in 1991, the stadium of which, was to become the
            centre piece of the Spanish Olympics the following
            year. Five Spanish drivers have competed in their own
            Grands Prix, none of whom really made a mark in the
            annals of F1. Last year, run-off areas were enlarged
            and the <i>Nissan Corner</i> slightly altered on the
            4.72 Km circuit.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Irrespective of
            weather conditions, qualifying should pose little
            problem for all the teams that have tested in
            Barcelona over the past five months. It would be
            naive to assume that time hasn&#146;t been spent in
            fine tuning both wet and dry set-ups for the circuit
            and most of the cars should be on the pace straight
            away.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Either of the <b>Williams</b>
            <i>should</i> be a stone cold cert for pole with
            fastest times in the low 1.18&#146;s but, whilst
            there are several drivers still getting to grips with
            this unforgiving track, hungry new boys <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b> <i>(&quot;I am working on the last two
            right hand corners, as I find these difficult.&quot;)</i>
            and <b>Ralf Schumacher </b><i>(&quot;The track is
            bumpy and we have had to work very hard to get the
            right set-up.&quot;)</i>, are looking to make their
            mark. <b>Rubens Barichello</b> flushed with success
            from his second place at Monaco for Family <b>Stewart</b>,
            may be flying on the wings of invincability (and also
            the new Zetec Project 6 version Ford engine).
            Benetton Drivers Alesi and <b>Gerhard Berger</b> will
            be desperate to qualify in the top ten as will the <b>McLaren</b>s
            of <b>David Coulthard</b> and <b>Mika Hakinnen</b>.
            Last year 2.4 seconds separated the first 10 places
            but with so many competitive teams looking to
            impress, one can expect this gap to be significantly
            narrower. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the new spec <b>Yamaha</b>
            engine which has shown to produce less power than the
            old and being ditched in favour of the devil they
            know, <b>TWR Arrows</b> driver <b>Damon Hill</b> will
            be glad if he can equal his 1.20.65 pole position
            from 1996 and, if that puts him in the top 10 then he
            will have done well. But to complete a race for the
            first time this season, would be for him, a personal
            triumph.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It seems that everyone
            is praying for rain, again. <b>Martin Whitaker</b>,
            Ford Director of European Motorsport commented, <i>&quot;The
            performance of the Stewart Ford in the wet is
            exceptional so I don&#146;t suppose anyone in the
            team will be too upset if the conditions of last
            years race were repeated.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even Schumacher senior
            wishes he was somewhere else. <i>&quot;To be honest I
            would prefer to cancel Spain because it is not a
            circuit that suits our car but now that I have opened
            a small gap, I suppose I can afford to go for a
            finish in the points. It definitely will be
            tough.&quot;</i> Poor old Michael, resigned to having
            to go for a points finish. Ho Hum, but finish in the
            points, he surely will, probably just behind <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It seems that <b>Goodyear</b>&#146;s
            asymmetrical tyres are almost a match for the <b>Bridgestone</b>
            wets that have still to be tested in anger
            (Intermediates were used in Monaco) so don&#146;t
            expect surprises. The top four will probably not
            change, but inclement weather could benefit the teams
            that are prepared for all conditions and, to look at
            the sky rather than their crystal ball.</font></p>
