        first three Grands Prix of the 1997 season how would you
        sum up the Jordan Peugeot team's efforts - from a
        technical and from a sporting point of view?</i></b></font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Technically we
            have made constant progress. You can measure that by
            looking at our performances in qualifying in
            Australia where we were 12th and 14th on the grid. We
            were seventh and 10th in Brazil and in Argentina, 6th
            and 9th. Apart from the fact that our young drivers
            have made progress, I think one has to underline the
            fact that this year Jordan produced the car very late
            so as to have extra time for the research and
            development and the fabrication process. The chassis
            engineers - and the engine builders - are getting to
            know the car which was not possible during the
            limited amount of pre-season testing. Consequently we
            are on an upward curve in terms of performance and
            development. Having said that, the various split
            times at the three circuits we have already visited
            show that the engine is right up there and has
            already reached the level of competition which was
            expected of it at least in the first half of the
            season.&quot;</font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">''The late arrival of
            the car meant that we had to put a lot of faith in
            the reliability while focusing on better performance.
            During the pre-season testing and in the first races,
            we demonstrated that we had a strong car - in
            comparison to the competition. The Jordan Peugeot Is
            very competitive right through a Grand Prix. The 1997
            car is a lot more aerodynamically advanced than last
            year's car. This improvement in aerodynamic downforce
            gives more grip. The car is much stiffer and better
            balanced. The rigidity between the car and the engine
            and the engine and the gearbox - which we worked
            together on - is much better. It provides greater
            stability and the aerodynamic performance is constant
            and depends less on the pitch-angle of the car.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As far as the Peugeot
            A14 engine is concerned, it is more compact and has
            less internal friction losses. It is also more
            powerful but has not lost any of the torque, which
            combined makes it a step forward everything is going
            in the right direction.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;When we first
            looked at it, we felt that the beginning of the
            season showed that the drivers still needed to
            improve their performance in qualifying - just like
            the car. The result of the race depends more than
            ever on the grid position taking into account the
            situation in which a driver can drop back several
            rows for want of a couple of tenths of a second. We
            are obliged to run the cars with different settings
            in qualifying and the race. To do this, the team and
            the drivers need experience to adapt to particular
            set-ups which can make all the difference and it must
            be done very quickly. Our drivers Ralf Schumacher and
            Giancarlo Fisichella are quick. There is no doubt
            about that, but when you look at the telemetry from
            qualifying, you see that their best sector times do
            not occur on the same laps. They need to put it all
            together a little bit more to produce the best
            possible performances ''</font></p>

            eliminated Fisichella after a crash with Schumacher.
            After each race we have a chassis-engine debriefing
            and we discuss technical and tactical aspects of the
            race. When there is an Incident such as there was in
            Argentina which cost us points and a good finish we
            obviously have to speak to Jordan to define cases in

        races at the start of the season - which do not give you
        much chance to make technical changes -the European
        season is now upon us. What is the programme of
        developments for the next few races? </i></b></font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We are working
            on ways to adapt the engines to the different tracks
            we visit. The work of the engine-builder consists of
            precisely refining the engine mapping to fit a
            circuit that we already know - thanks to previous
            experience. On the chassis side after not doing much
            development during the first three races, we are
            embarking on the European tour with some pretty big
            changes ahead even if they do not seem spectacular.
            These include an improved aerodynamic package which
            according to the figures from the wind tunnel, ought
            to give us two or three tenths of a second a lap.
            That is one row further forward on the starting grid.
            In terms of mechanical bits, Jordan is developing an
            active differential which means that the driver can
            press a button on the steering wheel and the set-up
            of the differential will change to suit the next
            corner whether that is a hairpin or a 150mph sweeper.
            At the moment we are using a passive system which is
            a bit of a compromise. The aim is to have the new
            differential in time for Monaco and that ought to
            bring us some improvement.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Jordan team
            is no longer a small operation. It is now an
            average-sized team it has grown from 70 to 120
            people. This includes an aerodynamics department
            which now has four people, compared to the old
            arrangement where Gary Anderson did the work himself.
            The number of days in the wind tunnel has gone from
            50 to 120 in a year. The team has bought its own wind
            tunnel located at Brackley not far from the factory,
            and this will be operational in May. The team has
            also established a quality-control department to
            inspect the many parts which are supplied by
            sub-contractors. Jordan has bought itself a gearbox
            test bed so that transmissions can be checked before
            they are put into a car. The biggest step forward,
            however, is the purchase of a four-post rig which
            enables the team to simulate the pitch, roll and
            aerodynamic loadings of a car in relation to
            individual track surfaces. This is all reproduced
            using recorded data and can be used when we are away
            at a Grand Prix to help establish setup.&quot;</font></p>

            circuit demands a lot from an engine, which ought to

            need for power in very different and difficult
            circumstances, in places which have very low revs.
            The smoothness of the response or our engine ought to
            be able to cope with that. You have to have a pretty
            good car - even if the tyres will be a bit of an
            unknown factor. But the Jordan engineers have sorted
            out the problems of last year's car which was very
