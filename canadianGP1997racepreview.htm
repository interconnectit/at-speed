            size="2" face="Arial">ituated on the Isle Notre Dame
            in the middle of the St Lawrence Seaway the <i>Circuit
            Gilles Villeneuve </i>is laid out in parkland amidst
            the &#145;retro futurism&#146; of once thrilling
            pavilions of the 1967 Montreal Expo. It was designed
            by <b>Roger Peart</b> as a quick remedy to fulfill
            the requirements of the ever increasing speed of the
            new breed of Formula 1 cars, too fast for the
            outdated road circuit at <i>Mosport Park </i>in
            eastern Ontario<i>. </i>The requirements of rising
            local hero <b>Gilles Villeneuve</b> had to be
            fulfilled after his trouncing of<b> James Hunt</b>
            and <b>Alan Jones</b> in the Formula Atlantic
            &#145;round the houses&#146; at <i>Trois Rivieres</i>
            in 1976 and he repaid the faith of his fans by
            winning his first Grand Prix at the inaugural race in
            1978. Paid for in part, by the Canadian brewers <b>Labatts</b>,
            it was severely criticised by drivers for being too
            slow. It was subsequently modified but, with its
            ultra long straits interrupted by slow corners and
            chicanes, it is extremely hard on the cars,
            especially under braking.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Montreal is no
            stranger to tragedy as the events in 1982 showed,
            when the track was renamed just a month after Gilles
            Villeneuve&#146;s death in <i>Belgium,</i> in his
            honour. <b>Ricardo Paletti</b> drove his <b>Osella
            Ford</b> into the back of <b>Didier Peroni</b>&#146;s
            stalled Ferrari on the grid and, after being pulled
            from the burning wreckage, died a short while later.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Whilst it seems to be
            generally liked by drivers 20 years on, it is often
            regarded as a &#145;stop &#145;n go&#146; track. As <b>Mika
            Salo</b> said last year, <i>&quot;...you have to have
            really good brakes and super traction. What you
            really need is a dragster...&quot;</i> For this
            reason the &#145;point and squirt&#146; technique can
            produce rather dull racing.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Jordan Peugeot</b>,
            currently the fastest car in a straight line should
            be extremely optimistic about a podium this weekend.
            Technical Director <b>Gary Anderson </b>says of the
            circuit, <i>&quot;The Montreal track should suit our
            car quite well as the important things are good
            traction, braking and lots of power. As a circuit, it
            is similar to Imola - lots of chicanes, but it is
            much dirtier since it isn&#146;t used very often. The
            exit of the corners is more important than the entry,
            which makes things tricky.&quot;</i> He continues, <i>&quot;Braking
            is the key and there is a good deal of pressure on
            the brakes especially in the last chicane where you
            are approaching at speeds of 310Kmph and brake down
            to 70Kmph in the middle of the corner. It&#146;s easy
            to miss the chicane and find yourself in the
            pits!&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The omens look good
            for Jordan generally. Not only was it in Montreal in
            1995, that the team achieved its best ever race
            result with a second and third finish for <b>Rubens
            Barrichello</b> and <b>Eddie Irvine</b> but it was
            there last year when current driver <b>Giancarlo
            Fisichella</b> scored his best Grand Prix finish of
            1996 with an eighth place in a <b>Minardi</b>.
            Despite his guarded praise for the circuit,
            Fisichella said, <i>&quot;The long sweeping curve
            after the first chicane is very difficult and also
            quite dangerous. And I am not so keen on the hairpin
            bend..&quot;</i> Always one to take his racing
            seriously, he did express his desire to go shopping
            and take advantage of Montreal&#146;s excelent
            R&amp;R facilities to mix with the girls.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Barrichello, now
            driving for <b>Stewart Ford</b>, has less reason for
            optimism this year, the car and engine package is not
            ideally suited to such a power circuit. But,
            undaunted by his team&#146;s disadvantages he said, <i>&quot;Canada
            will cause us problems because the circuit does have
            a long straight, but on the other hand the surface is
            different from the abrasive one we have just raced on
            in Spain. I think Montreal could suit our car very
            well.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">His expectations are
            not shared by Stewart&#146;s Technical Director, <b>Alan
            Jenkins</b> who sensibly thinks that if anything will
            make a difference to their chances it will be the <b>Bridgestone</b>
            tyres and their performance in race conditions. The
            long straight, now with the chicane removed
            (installed to reduce speed, in one of many knee-jerk
            reactions to <b>Ayerton Senna</b>&#146;s death in
            1994), could prove to be their undoing. <i>&quot;It&#146;s
            very much a horsepower track these days and will be
            no easy trip.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;In recent
            years, Montreal with it&#146;s slow corners and long
            straights has changed and become a low downforce
            track. We shall be taking advantage of further
            development of the two-plane rear wing and a low
            downforce front wing flap originally intended for </i><b><i>Hockenheim</i></b><i>.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The team to savour the
            optimism this weekend is undoubtedly <b>Williams</b>.
            With every chance of either <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>
            or <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b> taking the chequered
            flag, the victory will be even sweeter for Boss <b>Frank
            Williams</b> as it will give him his 100th victory,
            making him the third most successful team in F1
            behind <b>Ferrari</b> (109 wins) and <b>McLaren </b>(105)
            since the Championship was first staged in 1950 and
            at his current strike rate, by the end of the season,
            he could (just), be top. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Damon Hill</b> took
            the French Canadian&#146;s home Grand Prix from him
            last year but there looks little likelihood of a
            repeat performance despite the decision to run the
            new marginally improved <b>Yamaha</b> D-spec engine
            in the <b>Arrows </b>in practice on Friday. If all
            goes well, they will use it for Saturday qualifying,
            but it is doubtful that confidence in the engine will
            be such that they would dare use it for the race.
            Like all the teams <b>Steve Clark, </b>Arrows
            Technical Director, is worried about the braking. <i>&quot;Braking
            puts a lot of energy into the discs and heats them up
            to about 1000 degrees and it&#146;s when they are hot
            that they wear a lot.&quot;</i> He said, <i>&quot;With
            the long straights they will cool down and with the
            short straights between the chicanes they will
            overheat.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Keen to produce a
            better show than last year, when his <b>Ferrari </b>lost
            a half-shaft and a load of assorted nuts and bolts
            pulling away from a pit stop, is <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b>. His team mate <b>Eddie Irvine</b>,
            fared no better with a broken front push rod on the
            second lap. Better prepared and seemingly more
            reliable this year, Ferrari<b> </b>should be in
            contention for a podium finish. <i>&quot;if our
            excellent reliability continues the way it has been
            this season, I am sure we can stay in strong
            contention for the title even though we might not
            have the quickest outright package at the
            moment.&quot;</i> Schumacher said recently.<i>
            &quot;I am confident that with the things we have
            coming throughout the season our chances will be
            getting even better,&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Benetton Renault</b>
            seem to be rediscovering themselves after their poor
            performances in the early part of the season.
            Fundamental design flaws in the B197 have been
            addressed and modified and in recent testing at <i>Magny
            Cours </i><b>Jean Alesi</b> set the pace and the
            fastest times. He will no doubt remember his one and
            only win in Canada in 1995, for Ferrari, after 91
            tries, breaking a winless drought for the <i>Scuderia</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After such a brilliant
            start to the season <b>McLaren</b> are desperate to
            prove that after a string of poor yet inexplicable
            performances, the win for <b>David Coulthard</b> was
            not a flash in the pan. The new high revving <b>Ilmor</b>
            prepared, F-spec <b>Mercedes</b> could be run for the
            first time in a race this weekend. After proving so
            impressive during qualifying in <i>Barcelona</i> last
            month, temptation is high but confidence in it&#146;s
            reliability under racing conditions is not unanimous
            and the decision will be made after qualifying on
            Saturday.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Olivier Panis</b>
            must be in with a shout in the <b>Prost Mugen-Honda</b>.
            Bridgstone will be taking great care to provide their
            teams with the correct tyres, a harder compound seems
            to be the current choice for the Japanese shod cars.
            Rumours of a new link with <b>Reynard</b> the chassis
            manufacturers for next year could also link
            Villeneuve with the French team despite his recent
            announcement that he will be driving a Williams. But
            when money talks a driver walks, so nothing can be
            certain until you see their name painted on the side
            of the cockpit.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Several teams have
            indicated their desire to run a one stop race
            strategy, but much will depend on the relationship of
            fuel load to tyre performance on the bumpy track.
            Also &#145;grippy&#146; tyres will be of a distinct
            advantage. Eddie Irvine commented, <i>&quot;You have
            to qualify well &#145;cos you can&#146;t overtake.
            But you need to have tyres that are hard enough to
            take you through the race with just one stop. It
            could be a casino out there.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course he&#146;s
            right. As usual the smart money is on the Williams
            and especially Villeneuve, after his rude defeat last
            year. But if you&#146;re really clever you would lay
            down a few dollars on the Jordan team to get yet
            another podium position and possibly a water tight
            contract for three more years of Peugeot power.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But one can&#146;t but
            help wanting the young Villeneuve to win if only for
            the sake of his countrymen. <i>&quot;I am really
            proud of my father,&quot;</i> He said last year, <i>&quot;and
            no matter what success I have as a driver, it will
            not diminish his accomplishments or what his memory
            means to F1 fans.&quot;</i> He will be the first to
            tell you that there is no pressure to win just
            because he is his father&#146;s son, but the desire
            to win in front of a home crowd is probably the
            greatest motivation there is.</font></p>
