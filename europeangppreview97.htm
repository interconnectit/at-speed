            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;Duels between
            the men at the top are always exhilarating to watch
            and that's true not just for motor racing, but also
            for life in general.&quot; </i><b><i>Alain Prost</i></b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It couldn&#146;t be a
            better ending. Ask <i>Michael Douglas</i> Hollywood
            star turned producer of an upcoming Formula 1 based
            thriller, how his film will end and he would be hard
            pushed to find a better scenario than what we can
            look forward to this weekend. It seemed that a month
            or so ago,<b> Michael Schumacher </b>had it all
            wrapped up in scarlet and <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>,
            the wayward head boy in the house of <b>Williams</b>,
            was playing truant on the track <i>&quot;nothing is
            ever what it seems.&quot;</i> said technical
            director, <b>Patrick Head</b>. Then a few lucky
            breaks came Villeneuve&#146;s way: a yellow flag
            driven <i>&#145;stop go&#146;</i> penalty for the
            German in <i>Austria</i>, a damaged 50 pence oil seal
            washer on <b>Damon Hill&#146;</b>s <b>TWR-Arrows</b>
            in <i>Hungary</i>, the Brothers&#146;
            Schumachers&#146; aerial antics and, a blown engine
            on <b>Mika Hakinnen</b>&#146;s <b>McLaren</b> in <i>Luxembourg</i>
            and there he was, nine points ahead, about to go home
            from Japan in a blaze of blue glory. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we know, the post
            race <i>Karaoke </i>night at the infamous Log Cabin
            club in the centre of the Suzuka circuit was not the
            usual scene of championship celebrations although
            Villeneuve managed a rendition of a <i>Guns &#145;N
            Roses</i> song <i>&#145;Sweet Child of mine&#146; to
            take some of the disappointment away. </i>The last
            reel is yet to run, for we saw highly unlikely events
            in Japan strip the Canadian of his 2 championship
            points in yet another yellow flag incident resulting
            in disqualification from a race that he attempted to
            control to the detriment of <b>Ferrari</b>. Brilliant
            teamwork and strategy however, gave the <i>Scuderia</i>
            a first and third position and now, here is
            Schumacher a point up, getting out the scissors and
            selotape for the second time. What a preposterous
            ending! Get some new screenwriters that know about
            motor racing! Formula one doesn&#146;t end like this!
            Can we believe it, as we sit in our seats glued to
            phosphor screens around the world? It&#146;s hard,
            but we have to, as the final showdown approaches.
            With 3200 miles covered in 25 hours or so of solid
            racing, it comes down to a single point. A tie break,
            a penalty shoot out, it&#146;s all on the black or in
            this case, the red and the blue.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are other
            contenders of course and several potential winners. <b>McLaren</b>
            is still looking for further spoils especially
            Hakinnen so richly deserving of a win this year
            having two potential podium finishes cruelly snatched
            away by mechanical faults. <b>Jordan </b>will be
            trying hard to make that first trip to the top of the
            podium for the ever improving <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b>
            in his final race for the team before he moves to <b>Benetton</b>,
            who in turn having tasted success with the outgoing <b>Gerhard
            Berger</b> would dearly like to go out on a high.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The winning at this
            point in the game though, is irrelevant for the two
            arch rivals. Whosoever&#146;s rubber crosses the line
            first, will take home the prizes, leaving the other
            to wonder where it all went wrong, pick up the pieces
            and start all over again next season.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Designed by the
            Spanish architect and urban planner <i>Tato Nogues</i>,
            <i>Jerez </i>was constructed in 1985, largely through
            the initiative of <i>Pedro Pacheco</i>, the
            City&#146;s Mayor who thought it a sound investment
            for promoting the Country&#146;s famous Sherry region
            to the world. Jerez, situated in the dry and
            under-populated Andalusian region, lacks atmosphere
            and has only been used six times for a Formula 1
            event. <i>Jerez </i>succumbed to the new purpose
            built arena circuit of <i>Montmelo-Catalunya</i> in
            1991, the stadium of which, was to become the centre
            piece of the Spanish Olympics the following year. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Modifications to the
            circuit, carried out in 1992 and again in 1994 for
            the <i>European Grand Prix</i>, removed the chicane
            on the back straight leading in to the appropriately
            named <i>&#145;Dry Sack&#146;</i> to create some
            overtaking potential and added a chicane <i>(Ayrton
            Senna)</i> on the fast sweeping <i>Ducados</i>
            right-hander where <b>Martin Donnelly</b> crashed
            with near fatal results following a mechanical
            failure on his <b>Lotus</b> during Qualifying for the
            final Spanish Grand Prix at the circuit in 1990. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;It&#146;s
            another driver&#146;s circuit similar to Suzuka and
            Spa.&quot; </i>Says <b>Jordan Peugeot</b>&#146;s
            technical director <b>Gary Anderson</b>.<i> &quot;The
            pit straight leads into a third gear right hander
            which is an uphill braking corner and then into a
            tight second gear hairpin. This leads to the fastest
            part of the track, through two fast left handers and
            is very demanding.&quot; </i>He continued,<i>
            &quot;There is an overtaking opportunity at the end
            of the back straight. This and the first corner are
            the only places to overtake. Coming out of the Dry
            Sack hairpin, there are two left handers, one flat
            and the second tightens up and needs some care and
            thought. It is easy to lose time on the following two
            right handers as the tendency is to overdrive the
            first which puts you out of line for the second.
            After the Senna Chicane put in after Donnelly&#146;s
            accident a tight hairpin leads you back to the pit
            straight. The driver&#146;s here have a big input on
            performance since there is more to doing a good lap
            than simply accelerating and braking.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The track should
            distribute it&#146;s favours fairly evenly to most
            teams with equal amounts of high speeds and heavy
            braking, but Pole of course, will give a huge
            advantage to the quickest qualifier. Such a grippy
            track will be hard on tyres and it seems that <b>Bridgestone</b>
            may have the slight edge. A soft compound tyre for
            the Japanese company might just pay dividends to the
            mid field runners. <b>Goodyear</b> would be wise to
            bring the same spec rubber that they used in <i>Japan</i>
            as both the Williams and the Ferrari went well.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There has been
            speculation that the two drivers might have a
            &#145;coming together&#146;, as the leading
            protagonists did, so famously in Adelaide at the end
            of the 1994 championship. Schumacher, one point ahead
            of Damon Hill, lost control of his car and rebounded
            from a wall into the Englishman&#146;s path, so
            taking the championship. Whether the direction of his
            Benetton could have been controlled to avoid Hill,
            will remain a contentious issue. Villeneuve however
            was on the offensive at the pre race press conference
            when he said, <i>&quot;If I am one point behind, all
            Michael, or his team-mate Eddie Irvine, need to do is
            take me off the track,&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Patrick Head</b>
            commented, <i>&quot;The man who gets ahead is in a
            position where, as we&#146;ve seen before, he can be
            very aggressive with the person behind. I think
            that&#146;s what happened to Damon in Adelaide in
            &#146;94, a deliberate removal of a competitor. The
            man with less points has to be very careful if
            he&#146;s challenging for the lead.&quot;</i>
            Ironically, the same accusations were levelled at
            Williams before <i>Suzuka</i> when Villeneuve had the
            points advantage, but common sense has to prevail and
            both drivers are at pains to ensure that their
            fighting is fair up to a point, but most definitely
            legal.<i> &quot;I won't play it dirty,&quot;</i> Said
            Schumacher, <i>&quot;I want the championship decided
            on the race track, not across a table in a court in
            Paris or in a collision.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Bernie Ecclestone,</b>
            67 year old F1 ringmaster issued a stern warning to
            both drivers and threatened severe repercussions if
            it came to dirty driving on the track. <i>&quot;The
            guilty party can expect to be a spectator in the
            first few rounds in 1998. We will also hit them where
            it really hurts, in their wallets, if they step out
            of line,&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;Accidents do
            occur in the heat of the moment, especially when
            there is so much at stake. But we don't want them to
            do anything silly. But past championships have been
            decided by one driver taking another off and it must
            not happen again.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a small but
            significant moment after a successful qualifying for
            Ferrari at Suzuka, Schumacher&#146;s team-mate <b>Eddie
            Irvine</b> jokingly said, <i>&quot;I hope to make the
            best start, pass both of them and then let Michael
            pass me!&quot;. </i>Which is <i>exactly</i> what he
            did. Any further jocular comments by Irvine this
            weekend before the race, should noted with the
            innuendo with which they were, in hindsight, probably
            intended.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite Williams
            having the upper edge mechanically, Ferrari have the
            driver to beat. On a sunny day it will be a close
            call, but if it rains as it did at the last <i>European
            Grand Prix </i>in<i> Jerez </i>in 1994, the <i>SS
            Schumacher</i> steamed to an easy victory. Nothing
            more, this year in Formula 1, can shock or amaze us
            and for history to repeat itself, would only be
            expected. But then Villeneuve is one of the few
            drivers that can overtake almost anywhere and tracks
            such as Jerez with little passing opportunity hold no
            fear for him. Either way, it&#146;s almost as if the
            previous sixteen races hadn&#146;t happened. Sixty
            nine laps will see the results of a truly amazing
            season.</font></p>
