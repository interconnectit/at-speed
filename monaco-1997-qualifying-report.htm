            face="Arial">In the closing moments of the most
            eagerly anticipated qualifying session of the season
            so far, <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b>, driving his <b>Williams
            FW19</b>, clinched thefirst pole position of his
            career. A rather frustrating hour was had by drivers
            suffering generally from a lack of mechanical grip
            and marginal downforce settings.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From the outset the
            contest seemed to be between only four drivers, one
            of which, <b>Giancarlo Fisichella,</b> driving with a
            maturity and experience beyond his years, found
            himself in a head to head with mid session pole
            sitter <b>Michael Schumacher</b>, briefly attaining a
            place alongside him at the front of the grid.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By contrast
            Frentzen&#146;s Team mate <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>,
            anxious to better his dreadful performance last year,
            found it hard to get to grips with the circuit,
            making life difficult for himself with a succession
            of rather untidy laps. His speed was undeniable
            however and on his fastest lap, with six minutes
            remaining, he was up on Schumacher in both sections.
            Distracted by the <b>Tyrrell</b> of <b>Jos Verstappen</b>
            coming into the <i>Anthony Noghes</i> corner onto the
            pit straight, his car twitched first left then right
            coming within millimeters of the barriers and it
            undoubtedly lost him the pole. Still recovering from
            his mistake he booted the car unnecessarily hard into
            <i>Ste Devote</i> after passing the start finish
            line, losing his rear end and suspension in a hard
            swipe with the Armco and came to a premature stop
            dangerously close to the tunnel entrance five turns
            later. His earlier time was sufficient to enable him
            to keep third position. <i>&quot;I was going for it
            and it wasn&#146;t the car.&quot;</i> He said,
            seemingly unconcerned and rightly so, about the
            presence of the Tyrell, <i>&quot;I made a few
            mistakes in my last lap, mostly in the last corner
            and lost enough time to not get pole.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The best was yet to
            come, for even as Villenueve was coasting to a
            standstill, Frentzen was starting his final set of
            laps and, a little less than two minutes of
            electrifying driving, saw the young German not only
            topple fellow countryman and sparring partner
            Schumacher from a superb pole held for most of the
            session, but, after taking his first win at Imola
            recently, again put his team mate on the defensive
            and take a psychological advantage for the start of
            tomorrow&#146;s race. Commendably shy he just said, <i>&quot;A
            very pleasant moment!&quot;</i> and added with a
            smile, <i>&quot;I&#146;m in a good mood!&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schumacher, despite a
            desperate bid in the last 5 seconds of qualifying and
            in a Ferrari that seemed a lot happier on the twisty
            circuit, was unable to better Frentzens time, ending
            the hour 3 thousandths of a second slower than the
            Williams time of 1.18.216. <i>&quot;It&#146;s not
            satisfying having been on pole for most of the
            session,&quot; </i>He said, <i>&quot;but I have
            enough reason to be satisfied, being 2nd in front of
            another Williams.... Mr V!&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Teammate <b>Eddie
            Irvine</b> suffering badly from understeer, was
            unable to get higher then 15th, his car, in complete
            contrast to Schumacher&#146;s looked unsettled and
            unwieldy. In his almost musical Irish lilt, he
            moaned, <i>&quot;We put new sets of tyres on but
            nothing changed.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The glummest face in
            the pitlane belonged to young <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>
            who was unable to push his <b>Jordan Peugeot</b> to
            the limits that his team mate and arch-rival had
            achieved. <i>&quot;I am not satisfied with the
            position I made-it is my fault I did not manage to go
            any faster.&quot;</i> He grumbled, <i>&quot;I am
            frustrated because I wanted to do better.&quot; </i>He
            has indeed been outclassed by Fisichella all weekend
            and whilst both have driven the circuit before,
            albeit in lesser Formulas, the performance of the
            Jordan team thus far at Monaco has been creditable to
            say the least and should go a long way in helping
            them to keep their supply of works <b>Peugeot </b>engines
            for next year. Giancarlo, understandably was over the
            moon, <i>&quot;I am very happy with this result, as I
            had set myself a target of finishing in the top six,
            so second row on the grid is Fantastic! For the race
            I am really hoping to be on the Podium.&quot; </i>For
            a young driver to be saying such things after only 4
            F1 races and in his first season, is confidence
            indeed.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ironically, the team
            that have been instrumental in hanging this Peugeot
            Sword of Damocles above Team Boss <b>Eddie Jordan</b>&#146;s
            head, did not fare so well. <b>Shinji Nakarno </b>under
            threat of the sack by boss <b>Alain Prost</b> did
            little to improve his job prospects by finishing
            second to last in front of <b>Jos Verstappen</b>&#146;s
            tug-boat <b>Tyrell</b>. Even Prost number one driver,
            <b>Olivier Panis</b> winner of this race last year,
            could do no better than 12th, his soft compound <b>Bridgestone</b>s
            for the first time this season losing advantage to
            the &#145;hards&#146; that most of the <b>Goodyear </b>teams-with
            the exception of McLaren-seemed to be running.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Damon Hill&#146;s</b>
            lamentable progress downward in the <b>TWR</b> <b>Arrows
            A18</b>, proceeded with vigour as, despite only being
            a little under a second and a half off the pole time,
            he only managed to beat his team mate <b>Pedro Diniz </b>in
            the closing stages of the session ending his day
            13th, but, as of late, still a regular finisher in
            front of one or other of the <b>Benettons</b>. <i>&quot;I&#146;m
            not happy about being 13th,&quot; he stated,
            &quot;but everyone in the team made a good
            effort.&quot;</i> Starting to talk about his car, he
            obviously thought better of it and merely said, <i>&quot;It&#146;s
            always fun to drive here though.&quot;</i> New fires
            will undoubtedly be lit this weekend regarding
            rumours of the World Champion&#146;s possible signing
            with any number of teams for next season. Hill has
            been practically invisible this weekend which will
            not amuse his sponsors and he probably did not
            envisage his Champion&#146;s <i>patina </i>disappearing
            quite so fast. Monaco, being the one circuit where
            the Arrows may have had a look-in towards the front
            of the pack, could signify an early Swan song for his
            time with TWR.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both the Benettons and
            <b>McLarens</b> continued to disappoint. <b>David
            Coulthard</b> finishing as highest Brit, in 5th and <b>Mika
            Hakkinen</b>, who clipped the inside barriers exiting
            the new Swimming pool complex, <i>piscine</i>, a
            rather fortunate 8th. With <b>Jean Alesi</b> a row
            behind and <b>Gerhard Berger </b>a distant 17th, the
            pecking order in the top five teams is definitely
            beginning to change.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Johnny Herbert</b>,
            despite heading the tables in the mornings warm up
            and also on Thursday&#146;s timed practice, only
            managed seventh for the <b>Sauber Petronas </b>team.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Rubens Barichello</b>
            scraped into the top ten in a strictly average <b>Stewart
            Ford</b>, but happily cosseted within his new team,
            he could have come last and exuded positivism. <i>&quot;This
            morning we had a problem with torsion bars on my car,
            so we had to change the set-up for qualifying. In a
            way we had to guess at another type of set-up.&quot;</i>
            Rather mystifyingly and, bearing in mind his final
            position, he continued, <i>&quot;In the end the car
            was even better than this morning, which just goes to
            show how well the team are working. If you look at
            the times you can see how little it would have taken
            for us to be in the top six.&quot;</i> Well, quite
            but that&#146;s what all the teams except one, are
            saying.<i> &#145;If only....&#146;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With barely 2 seconds
            covering the first 17 places and only 3, the whole
            grid, and despite the Williams and Ferrari&#146;s
            being regarded as unbeatable, cars have not been so
            evenly matched since 1978, when the start of the
            Turbo years and big money sponsorship enabled
            enormous gulfs in chassis and engine development to
            polarise the grid.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One has of course to
            put the sensible cash on the likes of Schumacher,
            Frentzen and (maybe not quite so much), Villeneuve.
            But if you were a betting man, you&#146;d go with
            Fisichella for Victory and most definitely, as he
            says, a podium finish. The processional nature of the
            track will mean that other than co-operating back
            markers, overtaking will be a pig and the closer a
            driver can judge his distance from the barriers, the
            more tenths of a second a lap will be gained.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To finish here will be
            of the utmost importance not only for the teams but
            for the sponsors who will be looking for their
            investment to absorb and eventually reflect the
            success that they all crave association with.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There has ever been a
            dull race at Monaco and this looks to be no
            different. There may even be an Italian flag hanging
            over the podium.</font></p>
