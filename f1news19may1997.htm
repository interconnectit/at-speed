            <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Interview with
            Jean-Pierre Boudy Chief Engineer, </b><b><i>Peugeot
            F1</i></b><b> engines Prior to the Monaco Grand Prix</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>When you take
            into account the remarkable progress made in F1
            engine development, can one still describe Monaco as
            a unique track which makes special demands in terms
            of engine preparation?</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Monaco is not a
            typical circuit because it is one of the rare tracks
            where the engine revs drop to extremely low levels-as
            in Budapest and in the <i>La Source hairpin</i>
            section at <b>Spa-Francorchamps</b>. The revs go to
            around 5000-6000rpm which is quite a contrast to
            running at Imola where they run at full throttle for
            65% of the lap. To prepare for Monaco we make some
            small modifications but there is nothing fundamental.
            The differences between the engines we run in <b>Imola</b>,
            <b>Brazil</b> or <b>Monaco</b> are minimal.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>How many times
            in a lap of Monaco do the revs drop that low?</i></b><b>
            </b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It is most
            obvious visible in the <i>Rascasse</i> section and at
            the <i>Loews hairpin</i>. The difficulty comes when
            the driver accelerates from very low revs at the exit
            of this kind of comer - the Rascasse, the Loews and
            to some extent at the Anthony Noghes corner which
            leads onto the start-finish straight. He has to be
            able to control the power in all circumstances but at
            these places in particular. The goal of the
            engine-builder is to keep the power curve as smooth
            as possible because if the power arrives too quickly
            it can cause uncontrollable wheelspin and you need to
            avoid that. This is the first thing to take into
            account. So far this season our drivers have not
            complained about wheelspin but we are not overlooking
            the possibility. With every Grand Prix we are making
            progress with the way power can be used. At Imola,
            for example, we refined the engine-map of our V10 to
            get the most out of it.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>When you are
            setting up an engine do you have to make compromises
            and sacrifice one aspect of an engine in favour of
            another - as chassis engineers have to do?</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Absolutely, when
            we are faced with brutal power delivery you have to
            try and get rid of it. That means one has to
            sacrifice something. I don't want to go into too much
            detail about that.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Do the drivers
            immediately notice such changes?</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Sure. They feel
            that the engine is easier to use but they are also
            aware that what has been lost is not as important as
            the ability to use the horsepower.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Despite the
            considerable progress that has been made, is the
            Monaco track still a difficult one for the
            engine-builder and thus for the driver?</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Our drivers have
            not indicated any problems this season and we are
            optimistic for Monaco. We will not really know until
            after the first day of running after which there is
            always the possibility to change things when we are
            there.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>The Jordan
            chassis is very much better than last year, in what
            way will this help at Monaco?</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Jordan
            chassis has made a lot of progress in aerodynamic
            terms. That means it has more aerodynamic downforce
            which translates to better grip for the rear wheels.
            It is this easier to get the power onto the track.
            Just to go back to the problems an engine-builder
            faces at Monaco, I should add that this race is not
            as different as when we were running the 905
            sportscars in 500 km races and at the Le Mans 24
            Hours. At the time we had two specific engines and
            that is not the case in F1.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Have you done
            any specific testing to prepare for Monaco or are you
            happy that you have been able to reproduce the track
            characteristics on the test bed?</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We recently ran
            a test on the short circuit at <b>Silverstone</b> but
            that was only to check a few small changes, nothing
            more than that. I should repeat that from a technical
            point of view Monaco does not represent an
            insurmountable challenge for an engine-builder. On
            the contrary to be reliable and competitive on a
            longer track like <b>Hockenheim</b> of <b>Monza</b>
            represents more of a challenge.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Despite their
            lack of experience, how are you finding working with
            Giancarlo Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher?</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Our two drivers
            give us good feedback about the engine and we have
            not really had any problems in this respect.
            Giancarlo is perhaps a little keener to make things
            perfect, although Ralf is pretty keen. In terms of
            using the engine to the maximum, in general Ralf is
            ahead although the difference between the two is
            minimal.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Forgetting the
            preoccupations of being an engine-builder, what do
            you hope the drivers will be able to achieve in
            Monaco?</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;They calmed
            themselves down at Imola, and they must keep going in
            that direction in Monaco. Both Giancarlo and Ralf
            have already raced on this track and so they know
            that the smallest mistake can be very costly: If they
            get it wrong it&#146;s the barriers and the
            cranes...&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Mosley resolute on
            new regulations</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Max Mosley</b>,
            President of the FIA, attacked <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>'s
            recent criticism of the 1998 proposed rule changes in
            a special press conference in Monaco on Saturday and
            stated that there was no prospect of revoking the new
            regulations due to be implemented next season. <i>&quot;As
            far as Jacques Villeneuve is concerned, he has said
            several things. If the 1998 specification cars are
            not &#145;fun' to drive, as he suggested, then I am
            sorry,&quot;</i> explained the President. <i>&quot;When
            he stated that because racing cars slow down more
            rapidly on big tyres and therefore crash with less
            energy, he was demonstrably wrong. And when he
            claimed that slower drivers would find it easier on
            grooved tyres to stay close to the most skilled
            drivers, all evidence is to the contrary. Indeed, if
            you believe that, you wipe out the history of
            motorsport. In effect, Jacques suggested that all
            racing drivers were mediocre until he came
            along.&quot;</i> Mosley continued, <i>&quot;As far as
            overtaking is concerned, Jacques said that on grooved
            tyres the braking distances would be no greater and
            that cars will be uncontrollable going into corners.
            But I believe that</i><b><i> Damon Hill</i></b><i>
            may be right in his separate contention that if
            braking distances are longer and a driver brakes
            late, then his car will indeed be uncontrollable,
            because it will be going too fast. I think the
            drivers will learn how to handle their cars on
            grooved tyres.&quot;</i><b> (see separate story)</b>.
            Villeneuve refused to comment any further saying <i>&quot;I
            just don&#146;t agree with Max.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Hill cautiously
            optimistic in &#145;grooved&#146; controversy.</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After recent testing
            with grooved <b>Bridgestone</b> tyres in Barcelona,
            Damon Hill found his <b>Arrows </b>slower and less
            enjoyable to drive, but was cautiously entheusiastic
            as to the possibilities for overtaking: <i>&quot;You
            don&#146;t get the buzz from going flat out through
            the corners. You actually have to drive the car more
            and you have to slide the car, drift it and play with
            the throttle.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;Obviously,
            the more grip, the more corners will be taken flat
            out. This means that as there are fewer corners where
            you are required to drive the car and there will be
            less difference between the good and less good
            drivers.&quot;</i> Regarding Villeneuve&#146;s
            comments about having less &#145;fun&#146; in the new
            spec cars, Hill continued, <i>&quot;Jacques says he
            wants it to be more dangerous, well, it will be, so
            he shouldn't complain about it. I think it is
            difficult to quantify how much safer it is going to
            be. The cars will corner slower and you will have
            less grip in the faster corners, so you may stand a
            higher chance of falling off.&quot; </i></font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Damon Hill</b> was
            also in the spotlight after comments he made when his
            <b>TWR Arrows</b> car failed to finish once again at
            Imola three weeks ago. He was at pains to point out
            exactly what he had said when he met the press in
            Monaco. <i>&quot;My remark was to inform people like
            you of the situations and the problems which we face
            as a team. It wasn't a threat at all, it was a
            statement of fact, a statement about the situation.
            On the grid at Imola it was obviously not very
            pleasing to have another leak. Everyone on the team
            knows it has got to be fixed, instead of continually
            pulling our car back into the garage, we want to make
            progress. We want to do well and everyone is keen to
            see that happen as soon as possible.&quot;</i> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill's name is already
            being linked to a number of teams next season
            including <b>McLaren</b>, <b>Prost, Jordan</b> and <b>Benetton</b>.
            <b>Patrick Head,</b> Hill&#146;s former technical
            director at <b>Williams,</b> knows him as well as
            anybody and doesn&#146;t think that <b>Tom Walkinshaw</b>
            will be able to hold him for next year. <i>&quot;Either
            Walkinshaw can provide the car he wants or he will
            look for it elsewhere.&quot; </i>He said. &quot;<i>Hill
            is a well-sorted type who doesn&#146;t want to spend
            his life at the back of the grid. I&#146;m sure he
            would rather be at home with his wife and children
            than doing that.&quot; </i>Hill was being tight
            lipped about his options. <i>&quot;I haven't spoken
            my views on anything yet,&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;I'm
            investigating all possibilities, but right now I'm
            focusing on Arrows. Anything else is very much hot
            air, I'm afraid.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The hot rumour
            floating around the pit lane, is that whilst engaging
            in conversation with <b>Ron Dennis</b> regarding a
            future drive with McLaren <b><i>(see previous Speed
            news update)</i></b>, Jordan could be looking to do a
            deal with <b>Mercedes</b> who would bankroll
            Hill&#146;s drive with the Silverstone based company
            in exchange for the young German <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>
            currently signed on a two year contract with the
            team. Mercedes are anxious to get their hands on the
            German after missing the opportunity of netting his
            older brother Michael. Whether Hill would agree is
            another matter and seeing as his close friend, top
            aerodynamicist <b>Adrian Newey</b> is about to join
            the Woking based team and his former mechanic at
            Williams, David Brown is currently working with <b>David
            Coulthard</b>, McLaren could be the ideal home from
            home for him. With contracts on both McLaren drivers,
            Coulthard and <b>Mika Hakinnen</b> about to expire,
            it looks likely that there will be changes within the
            team for 1998. Expressing his admiration for Hill,
            Dennis as expected, remained vague about the whole
            thing. <i>&quot;Damon has won races and
            championships, but we will not reach the point where
            we look at this situation for a couple of months or
            so. It's easy to make a decision based on emotional
            grounds, picking up somebody from one place and
            putting them down in another,&quot; </i>he said.<i>
            &quot;But objectively, I can't really see any reason
            for changing our current drivers. Both have the
            potential to get the job done. We just have to give
            them the best car.&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Alain Prost, </b>it
            appears, has also been talking with Hill. The Paris
            based team would love to have him although Prost said
            that <i>&#145;it was too early to come to any firm
            decisions&#146;</i>. <b>Sauber </b>on the other hand
            would love Hill to partner No 1 driver <b>Johnny

            apparantly <i>&#145;only been delayed two weeks&#146;</i>
            to give time for repairs to the circuit, the

            held on 26 October will take place at Jerez and will
            be known as the &#145;European Grand Prix&#146;. It
            is hoped that works at the Estoril circuit will be

            of the race for November 9th. The FIA deny this, but

            carried out without delay. Having regard to the
            excellent relations which have now been established
            with the Portuguese government, the FIA is confident
            that the Portuguese Grand Prix will be back on the
            FIA Formula One World Championship calendar for 1998
            and thereafter and hopeful that Formula One cars can
            run again at Estoril before the end of 1997.&quot;</i></font></p>

            that the date for the Grand Prix at Jerez still
            stood, thereby filling up the available slots in the

            for Estoril, which would effectively extend the
            season, raising the total number of races to 18. A
            decision is expected at Barcelona this coming

            Magny Cours...Yamaha fails Diniz</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Damon Hill escaped
            unhurt from a crash at <b>Magny-Cours</b> on
            Wednesday when his Arrows-Yamaha A18 left the road at
            the fast Estoril corner. The team is investigating
            the precise cause of the incident which happened
            after the World Champion completed 16 laps at the <i>Circuit
            de Nevers</i>. On Tuesday Hill had completed 70 laps
            with a best time of 1m 17.39s, concentrating on
            evaluating tyres and improving the balance of the
            car. He eventually stopped when the Yamaha engine ran
            out of its allotted mileage. <b>Pedro Diniz</b> tried
            the new D-spec version of the Yamaha V10 on Tuesday
            and Wednesday. He completed 41 laps on the first day
            for a best time of 1m 18.36s but completed only just
            over two laps before the engine failed on Wednesday. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <b>Tyrrell </b>team
            had two constructive days testing at Silverstone
            where both <b>Mika Salo </b>and <b>Jos Verstappen</b>
            used the new <b>Cosworth ED5 V8</b> engine. Neither
            experienced any problem and the initial reports from
            the drivers was extremely encouraging, indicating
            satisfactory driveability in addition to extra power.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The cameras were
            rolling with Minardi driver <b>Jarno Trulli</b> the
            star. It was not for Minardi however, but co-owners
            of the team, Benetton, who had invited the young
            Italian to stand in for<b> Gerhard Berger</b> for a
            filming session at Barcelona. He was later invited to
            drive the car in Wednesday's test where he set a time
            of 1m 20.76s, a little over half a second down on
            Berger&#146;s fastest time, 1.8s slower than Alesi
            and 0.6sec slower than regular test driver <b>Alexander
            Wurz.</b> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is rumoured that
            Benetton boss, <b>Flavio Briatore</b>, unhappy with
            Alesi&#146;s performance this year, is looking at
            Trulli for a possible seat in &#146;98. It is not
            expected that Alesi will continue with the team.</font></p>
