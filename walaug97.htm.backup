        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Giancarlo Fisichella:</u>
        What a weekend for the man who was tipped to be Ralfey's
        underdog. Fisi has consistently walloped Ralf for most of
        the year with some very astute and safe drives, doing
        Eddie Jordan's team more good than Ralf has managed. His
        storming run in qualifying and for most of the race
        stamped this new boy's authority on Berger's gearbox.
        Full marks to Fisi, minus several million to that piece
        of debris that cut his tyres. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Gerhard Berger:</u>
        There's life in the old duffer yet. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Michael Schumacher:</u>
        He was lucky to salvage third from an
        uncharacterisitically quiet race for the German on his
        home turf. The fireworks in the crowd and this year's
        possible world champion were absent, but he scored the
        points and Jacques didn't. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Jarno Trulli:</u> Yay!!
        He's back and, yes, Olivier should be proud to have Jarno
        flying his flag. After a good race in Britain, Nakano has
        again lost the plot. Prost is a good team and Jarno will
        do well if he can grab the second seat next year if Damon
        doesn't. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Mika Hakkinen:</u>
        Third place was some consolation after the British
        disaster. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><u>LOSERS:</u></b> </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Jacques Villeneuve:</u>
        Do I have to say it again? </font><font color="#FF0000"
        size="2" face="Arial">STAYING ON THE TRACK IS ESSENTIAL</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> to winning a grand prix/world
        championship/etc. Even in a Williams. Lost the plot after
        stuffing around in&nbsp; a non-points finish place and
        spun off into the gravel all by himself. Loser, loser,
        loser. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Heinz-Harald Frentzen:</u>
        (<i>sigh</i>) MEMO TO PATRICK HEAD: Sack him...he's a
        loser. For someone who was so highly rated and replaced
        Britain's best driver since Stirling Moss (forget
        Mansell) he has done depressingly little. Running into
        Eddie Irvine and then blaming him for his own colossal
        stupidity is pretty poor form. <br>
        MEMO TO FRANK WILLIAMS: What were you thinking? Damon:
        quiet, committed, FAST, wins lots of races, loses a few.
        Frentzen: quiet, committed, fast (sometimes), stupid
        (most times), wins one race, loses other races.
        Hmmm....what's the problem with this picture? <br>
        MEMO TO DAMON HILL, OBE: The car you run is crap, your
        team likes Pedro more for a reason which escapes me, but,
        hey, Frentzen sucks in a Williams and Jacques isn't that
        much better, either. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Stewart-Ford:</u> The
        usual crap equipment from FoMoCo ruining a weekend. Dear,
        oh, dear... </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>David Coulthard:</u>
        One day it will all come together for McLaren. These are
        two very talented drivers and a good engine package...all
        it needs is that extra spot of whatever (Adrian Newey)
        and we're there. <br>
