<tr><td valign=top width=260><strong>Safety<br>
</strong>This is the most important thing to 
remember whenever you go to watch a 
motorsport event. It <em>is </em>a dangerous sport 
and that inevitably means that there are 
potential risks involved.<p>The key points to remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay attention to the marshalls. 
They're there to help you and 
protect you. If they tell you to stop 
standing somewhere then move!</li>
<li>Remember that rally cars travel 
quickly. Don't get in their way, 
don't put or drop debris into their 
path, and consider what might 
happen if there's an accident.</li>
<li>If you travel out to any of the more 
remote stages then please 
remember that it's a British winter. 
Dress appropriately, take some 
food and a hot flask, and 
remember to enjoy yourselves in 
spite of the flu you've just caught!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Travel.<br>
</strong>Travel early to avoid the disappointment 
of missing your favourite stages. 
Directions to each and every stage are 
available from this site in the <a href="staginct.htm">Stage Info</a> 
section and are there to help you.<br>
If you're following the rally from stage to 
stage then remember that the police will 
be in plentiful numbers. Getting a speeding 
ticket would spoil your day - so if you find 
you're going to be late for one stage then 
decide to skip it and aim for the one after 
it. It'll be easier and safer that way.<br>
2.5 million spectators were recorded at 
last year's event. It's going to be busy - so 
prepare yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Parking.<br>
</strong>Our advice is to always park in the official 
car parks. Anything else can, and often 
does, lead to tears. Details of all official 
parking for the 1996 RAC Rally are 
available in the <a href="staginct.htm">Stage Info</a> section.</p>
</td><td valign=top width=260><strong>Service Areas<br>
</strong>Most service areas on the rally are unable 
to accomodate spectators due to their size 
or location and spectators are kindly 
asked not to attempt to gain access to 
them. Two service areas, however, are 
open to spectators:<p><strong>At end of Leg 1, Saturday 23rd 
November.</strong><br>
Car and Coach park D, Elland Road, 
Leeds. First car due at 21:23<br>
Parking:in Car Park C opposite. 
Approach from M621 junction 1 via 
A6110 (outer ring road).</p>
<p><strong>At end of Leg 3, Monday 25th 
November.<br>
</strong>Bodelwyddan Castle, Off the A55 
(Chester to Abergele Road). First car due 
at 15:07<br>
Parking: on ONE side of adjacent public 
road. Approach via A55 - no parking on 
A55, if you do then your car will be 
towed away by the police.</p>
<p><strong>Safety in Service Areas.<br>
</strong>DO NOT try to take your car into the 
service area.<br>
DO NOT block the access roads to the 
service area.<br>
DO NOT crowd the service crews when 
they are working on the cars.<br>
DO NOT stand around the time controls 
at the entrance and exit of the service 
area.<br>
BE VIGILANT for cars and service 
vehicles moving in the service area and do 
not block their route.<br>
STAND IN SAFE PLACES in the areas 
set aside for you.<br>
OBEY the instructions of the marshals.</p>
<p><strong>The Speed Team.<br>
</strong>You may well see us travelling from stage 
to stage. Look out for a Peugeot 806 
mobile office with Orange stickers all over 
it and sitting inside will be the scruffiest 
bunch of reporters you've ever set eyes 
on! Say 'Hello' if you see us there!</p>
