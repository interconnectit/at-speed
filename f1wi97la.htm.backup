        WANTS TO HAVE FUN AT WILLIAMS UNVEILING</b></font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>T</strong></font><font
            face="Arial">here was no pomp and the circumstances
            were underrated, but when you are World Champions you
            have little to prove. That&#146;s indeed how it was when
            the new <b>Williams FW19</b> was unveiled to the world&#146;s
            press at the team's former base at Didcot, Oxfordshire,
            last Friday. With minimum fuss, the two Williams
            drivers <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b> and Damon Hill
            replacement, <b>Heinz-Harald Frentzen,</b> pulled
            back the blue &#145;Williams&#146; crested cover to reveal
            a car that is deceptively similar to last years model.
            Whilst<b> Adrian Newey </b>former aerodynamicist with
            Williams and designer of the car, was absent and
            glaringly unmentioned, technical director <b>Patrick
            Head</b> enthused about the new model. &quot;The FW19
            is basically a logical evolution of the FW17/18
            &quot;family&quot; but with a significantly lighter
            and more compact transverse six-speed gearbox working
            in conjunction with the latest lighter and lower <b>Renault
            RS9 V10</b> engine. The gearbox has been designed to
            blend into the shape of the mandatory deformable rear
            end so that it improves the airflow over the rear
            wing and the air-intake has been raised and
            re-shaped.&quot; Sounding confident, Head continued:
            &quot;This has given the Williams technical team an
            opportunity to create a car that will set standards
            in performance and drivability. Both drivers expect
            to win races and challenge for the title.&quot; </font></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img
            src="fw19laaa.jpg" width="200" height="157"></font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">The New
            FW19 - Photo from </font><a
            href="http://www.icnsportsweb.com/"><font size="2"
            face="Arial">ICN SPORTSWEB</font></a></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Whilst no one present doubted
            that one bit, both drivers looked a tad non-plussed
            during the proceedings. Frentzen remarked that
            Hill&#146;s championship win last year was going to
            be &#145;a difficult act to follow&#146;. Villeneuve
            on the other hand sounded almost like a weary man of
            the world when he complained that the current crop of
            cars were too slow: &quot;Formula one has gone
            overboard on safety.&quot; He said. &quot;It&#146;s
            now 20 times safer and if someone other than <b>Ayrton</b> <b>Senna</b>,
            or, if no one had died, they wouldn&#146;t have cared
            that much about it. I will stay in Formula one as
            long as I am getting fun out of my racing. There will
            be a different kind of pressure on me this year, a
            more positive pressure. Last year people were expecting
            me to fall flat on my face and I proved them wrong.
            This year I have to prove them right when they expect
            me to win the championship.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">As Frentzen made for a quick
            getaway in his helicopter, Patrick Head finished on a
            cautionary note. &quot;We are obviously hoping to
            continue our recent level of success, but nothing is
            certain in this business and there has not been
            enough comparative pre-season testing to establish
            how everybody is going.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;To add to the woes of all
            the unsuccessful teams last year , Williams announced
            that they will continue to use Renault engines for
            the next two years at least. The French company
            Mecachrome will develop the engines further with the co-operation
            of Renault who will sell them the units and the
            technical expertise. This will keep the team highly
            competitive, albeit a touch poorer, into the Millennium
            when it is expected that German engine manufacturer <b>BMW</b>
            will be lying between the rear wheels. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><b>Frank Williams</b> refused
            to be drawn on the subject of the up and coming
            manslaughter trial over the death of Ayrton Senna at
            Imola in &#146;94. He just said: &quot;it will not in
            any way influence the way we approach the
            season&quot;. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The car in Barcelona this week,
            where it will undertake an intensive programme of
            testing, is already 5 seconds a lap quicker than the <b>FW18C</b> that
            Frentzen ran before the launch of its successor. </font></p>
