            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>The circuit at
            Montreal used to be famous for its high consumption,
            of fuel. Refuelling has made the problem disappear.
            But does this gas-guzzling track have any effect on
            race strategies?</i></b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Like Imola the
            track in Montreal is one of the hardest in terms of
            fuel consumption. The possibility to refuel has
            certainly got rid of this, although we must carry 70
            kgs of fuel rather than the usual 60Kgs. That is the
            same for everyone and so it is not a problem. In this
            respect it really has become a circuit just like all
            the others - and so we have forgotten the terror of
            running out of gas.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Without the

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;lt certainly is.
            When there were turbo engines and big restrictions on
            fuel consumption, the engine builders were forced to
            run the engines with so lean a fuel mixture, that it
            spoiled the reliability. Today there are no such
            restrictions on our fuel mixture settings.&quot;</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Do you rank
            Montreal as one of the difficult circuits in the
            World Championships?</i></b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;No not really.
            The difficulties of Montreal are pretty much the same
            as we encounter throughout the season and which we
            can overcome easily enough. I don't know about the
            other manufacturers but at Peugeot we have an
            all-purpose engine, without special set-ups. This
            engine suits a circuit like Monaco as much as it does
            Silverstone or Monza. This year we no longer do any
            particular changes for individual circuits. We used
            to do that by altering the lengths of the inlet
            trumpets but this year we have managed to master this
            with engine-mapping to suit all types of circuit.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Our engine has
            the advantage of Being flexible in terms of revs and
            power output. We have now developed the torque so
            that we are able to supply drivers with an engine
            which is never brutal. No matter whether it is
            running high or low revs, with high or low loadings.
            In other words at any circuit. Perhaps we will learn
            more in the future which will give us new ideas but
            at the moment I cannot see what we can do to make it
            better.''</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Barcelona marked
            the end of the first third of the world championship.
            How does one analyse the progress the engine has
            brought to the first part of the year and can one
            distinguish that from the progress from the Jordan
            chassis?</i></b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Right now a lot
            of engines are competitive and the advantage of one
            engine over another depends on whether it is in a
            good or a bad chassis. That is where an engine
            advantage comes from. It is as simple as that. This
            year Peugeot Sport is powering a Jordan chassis which
            is markedly better than that of last year. That is
            one factor. If one was doing a comparative study with
            last year's package one would see that the
            combination is much quicker, for example, in the slow
            corners. This improvement is in the order of 10% and
            so one can say that the same corner which used to be
            taken at 100kph can now be taken at 110kph. This
            improvement in the chassis has certainly influenced
            the way the engine is used. It is easy to see the
            repercussions of this faster exit speed all the way
            to the next corner. We no longer find ourselves
            having to use the engine in critical or uncomfortabIe
            rev ranges. These gains in the slow corners are
            really down to the chassis.</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>But what if you
            put a Peugeot A12 engine from19960 into a 1997 Jordan
            chassis, how much performance would you lose?</i></b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I think this
            loss would be pretty noticeable. We have made a lot
            of progress in performance terms with the 1997
            engine. A little in maximum horsepower but mainly in
            mid range power where the engine is most frequently
            being used. That if you compare acceleration and
            power, the average power output has gone up several
            dozen horsepower. I think that such a gain is worth
            close to half a second a lap compared to last years
            enqine.&quot;</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>Would it be true
            to say that working with relatively inexperienced
            drivers has slowed down your progress? </i></b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;No, not at all.
            Of all the drivers we have known in the past only
            Martin Brundle had sufficient technical knowledge to
            help us understand and use the engine better. Our two
            young drivers are in any case supported by the
            telemetry. We are working with them, but given that
            the engine is working well in 98% of cases, there is
            no reason for them to worry about it. At this stage
            of the careers both <b>Ralf</b> <b>Schumacher </b>and
            <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b> are very concentrated and
            preoccupied with the set-up of their chassis.''</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;There is one
            constant factor. We are always trying to get more

            Very satisfactory package and now we can only
            progress in small amounts. It will certainly not be
            like the spectacular progress we were making in 1994
            when we had to make up a disadvantage of 50
            horsepower. Three years have passed and we are now at

            steering column theory in Senna trial</b></font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>(June 2, 1997) </b>For
            over three hours, <b>Damon Hill,</b> testified at the
            trial over the death of his former Williams team-mate
            <b>Ayerton Senna</b>, at Imola in 1994. He rejected
            the prosecution's main charge that Senna had died
            after the steering column on his Williams FW16 broke
            after modifications had been made prior to the race.
            Having studied the video footage with his race
            engineers at the time he could not agree with the
            court&#146;s findings. <i>&quot;there must have been
            another reason for the accident other than there had
            been a failure in the steering.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;It
            did not seem to me that there was anything to suggest
            that the steering column broke.&quot; </i>Having
            examined the steering column, on-board telemetry and
            aerodynamics, he had left the meeting convinced that
            modifications to the steering had not been the cause
            of the accident. He told the court, <i>&quot;There
            had to be something else.&quot; </i>Asked if if Senna
            had complained to him about his steering or the
            handling of his car, he said, <i>&quot;I can't
            remember. It was too long ago,&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The lawyer for
            William&#146;s, <b>Orieste Dominioni</b>, has already
            claimed that anomalies in the track surface were to
            blame and Hill&#146;s conclusions, that Senna lost
            control of his car after hitting mid-corner bumps
            whilst his tyre pressures were low- having been
            forced to run slow behind the safety car- echo those
            of the Williams team. After studying the video
            footage again in court, Hill noted that there were
            two occasions when he thought that Senna&#146;s car
            overstepped through the mid part of the corner where
            there were some marks on the track. <i>&quot;There
            are two distinct times when the car looks to be
            oversteering and the steering wheel is exactly the
            way that I would expect to see to correct a
            slide.&quot;</i> low tyre pressure and the state of
            the Imola track surface &#145;could not be ruled
            out&#146; said Hill, <i>&quot;You can&#146;t separate
            the two.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill, accompanied by
            his lawyer <b>Michael Breen</b>, remained impassive
            throughout the lengthy questioning by state
            prosecutor <b>Maurizio Passarini</b> and was vague on
            several points that he could not remember, especially
            on the modifications to his own steering. Hill said, <i>&quot;I
            don't remember the exact date but I seem to remember
            that it was before the start of the
            championship.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hill also stated that
            Tamburello was a corner that would not cause a
            problem in an F1 car, <i>&quot;It's not normally a
            difficult corner for a Formula One driver,&quot;</i>
            he said, <i>&quot;You'd have to lose an awful lot of
            concentration to get it wrong.&quot; </i>He was also
            asked about the warning lights that showed in his
            cockpit after the pace car left the track. <i>&quot;It's
            quite normal for lights to come on when you're
            driving at that speed.&quot; </i>He replied,<i>
            &quot;The cars are not designed to run slowly.&quot;</i></font></p>

            Having witnessed his racing career slip from the top
            to the bottom of the heap in three short months, he
            spoke candidly and optimistically at a recent open
            day at <b>Tom Walkinshaw</b>&#146;s headquarters that
            drew a crowd of 18,000 Hill fanatics. <i>&quot;I read

            before and this car is in it&#146;s early stages of

            potential would not be realised until at least the
            beginning of next season. &quot;<i>These things are
            not going to happen overnight.&quot; </i>He went on, <i>&quot;The

            a few million Hill fans already knew, <i>&quot;Our
            design team did not do a good enough job over the
            winter, but we've rectified that,&quot;</i></font></p>

            run with <b>Yamaha </b>in the first place knowing its
            dubious history with the<b> Tyrrell </b>team.
            Walkinshaw admitted to having had &quot;very, very
            serious' talks with &#145;a team supplier&#146;
            which, it is thought, could only be Yamaha. <i>&quot;I&#146;m
            sure there will be a response&quot;</i> he said.

            testing at <b>Magny Cours</b>, to run the
            disappointing revised D-spec engine at Montreal on
            June 15th, he said <i>&quot;We will have to wait a

            Williams driver <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b> was fastest
            in the recent 3 day test at the Silverstone circuit
            (27th-29th). With all teams present except <b>TWR
            Arrows</b> and <b>Minardi</b>, the outcome was as
            predicted, with the Canadian setting the benchmark
            time of 1.22.39 on Wednesday. The surprise of the
            session however, although it is now becoming more of
            a regular event, was the speed of the two <b>Jordan
            Peugeot</b> drivers. Team mates, <b>Ralf Schumacher</b>
            and <b>Giancarlo Fisichella</b> led the pace on the
            final day, despite Schumacher suffering from both oil
            leaks and fuel pump problems, to finish second and
            third overall respectively, the only other drivers to
            stay within 1.22s. Jordan&#146;s technical director, <b>Gary
            Anderson</b>, said, <i>&quot;As long as the track has
            quick corners and lacks grip, we should perform well.
            Barcelona was simply a blip.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Michael Schumacher</b>
            ran moderately successfully in his <b>Ferrari F 310B </b>fitted
            with the 046/2 engine on the Tuesday. The German
            covered a total of 68 laps, in race trim, with a best
            early time of 1m 25.703s. Testing was stopped on
            Wednesday morning, when the right rear link broke at
            the exit of Beckett&#146;s. The session resumed the
            following day, after inspection of the part was
            returned to Maranello for inspection. His best time
            of 1.23.40s, came on the final day&#146;s test when
            he drove all day in race configurations. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;It was
            important to do this test session on a track which we
            hardly ever visit,&quot;</i> said Schumacher at the
            end of the day. <i>&quot;The car was definitely good
            on the quick sections of the track, but it was less
            good aerodynamically in the slow to medium parts,
            just as we had seen in Barcelona. We will have to
            work hard to sort this out.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>McLaren </b>drivers<b>
            David Coulthard </b>and<b> Mika Hakkinen </b>showed
            that the quick times in Barcelona with the new <b>Mercedes
            F-spec</b> &#145;qualifying&#146; engine could be
            maintained. The scot ended the session 9th fastest,
            with Hakkinen two tenths down on Fisichella&#146;s
            time, in 4th.</font></p>

            absence of <b>Jean Alesi</b> and <b>Gerhard Berger</b>,
            who is undergoing minor surgery for a glandular
            infection. His time of 1.23.16 was barely 8 tenths of

            development programme. Rubens's progress, punctuated
            by a series of red flags and minor problems on
            Thursday, meant he could only cover 22 laps, with a
            best time of 1m 25.2s. Magnussen covered a total of
            70 laps for a 12th place of 1m 24.4s. He commented; <i>&quot;I
            could not feel an increase in power from the Spec 6

            driveable.&quot;</i></font></p>

            on aerodynamics and suspension, covering 54 laps with

            Jacques Villeneuve has had to disrupt his
            preparations for the Canadian Grand Prix to return to
            Paris on Wednesday (11th) to appear before the
            Sport&#146;s governing body, the FIA to explain his
            outspoken criticism of the new rules for next season.
            In an interview published in last Monday&#146;s
            German Publication <i>&#145;Der Spiegel&#146;</i> he
            claimed that the new rules designed to curb the ever
            increasing speed of Formula one cars, as
            &#145;crap&#146;. <i>&quot;I think it's going to take
            a lot away from the driver,&quot;</i> he protested. <i>&quot;Instead
            of still being the ultimate sport that it is, it's
            going to become more of a show and a circus.&quot; </i>Villeneuve
            has always advocated the &#145;fun&#146; aspect of
            driving and &#145;taking things to the edge&#146; and
            firmly believes that the FIA is going in the wrong
            direction with its rules regarding grooved tyres and
            a narrower car width. <i>&quot;We need bigger tires
            and 70% smaller wings,&quot;</i> he said, <i>&quot;There's
            no longer any difference between Monaco and a 160 kmh
            bend at Barcelona -- no faster heart beat, no
            adrenaline, nothing but disappointment,&quot; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Whilst all that
            Villeneuve has said had been widely reported over the
            past few months, it came as a shock to him that the
            German weekly magazine should publish it now. It is
            not expected that Villeneuve will get any
            disqualifications or fines for &#145;bringing the
            sport into disrepute&#146;. He believed that
            &#145;everyone should have the right to speak their
            minds&#146;. He also stated that he was only
            &#145;saying in public what 90 percent of the drivers
            say privately.&#146;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The other 10% includes
            World Champion Damon Hill who last month cautiously
            embraced the rules <b><i>(see Speed Motorsport news

            racing more exciting.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Asking for the hearing
            date to be rescheduled because of the disruption to
            his press and public commitments in Canada, the FIA
            declined his request, forcing Villeneuve to make a
            further double crossing of the Atlantic to arrive in
            Montreal in time for a press briefing on Thursday
            evening.</font></p>

            Eccleston&#146;e &#145;hot under the coller&#146;

            anyway. Realising the size of the motorsport industry
            in this country and it&#146;s value to the economy,
            the British government, aware that Ecclestone could
            sever manufacturing and development ties in the UK by
            moving the F1 centre to Asia, insisted that as a
            special dispensation for the time being at least, the
            ban would not necessarily affect the livery of cars,
            just the sponsorship of events. This would give teams
            time to secure alternative sponsorship. Since the ban
            on tobacco advertising in Britain, cars have been
            allowed to keep their sponsor&#146;s colours,
            replacing the brand names with team associated
            word&#146;s often in the same type face. Hence the
            Grands Prix of Britain, France, Germany and now
            Canada, will have had cars dressed up as cigarette
            packets with the names Marlboro, Rothmans, Mild Seven
            and Benson &amp; Hedges, replaced by <i>&#145;McLaren&#146;,
            &#145;Racing&#146;, &#145;Benetton&#146; </i>and<i>
            &#145;Jordan&#146;</i>, respectively. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jordan could hold on
            to their <b>Peugeot</b> engine deal despite having
            been earmarked for <b>Prost Grand Prix</b>'s use on a
            five-year deal beginning in 1998. Jordan&#146;s
            improvement this year could extend the deal for a
            further three years. As a fail safe measure, Jordan
            have been courting <b>Mugen-Honda</b> as a possible
            replacement and the deal has in part, been engineered
            by Alain Prost who desires complete exclusivity of
            the highly rated French V-10. Peugeot are likely to
            announce their plans at the <b>French Grand Prix</b>.
            In a recent dispute between Prost and Honda, it is
            alleged that Prost gave Peugeot access to view the
            Honda engines on a recent visit to the team factory. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This incident could
            have given Mugen the leverage to keep Nakano at Prost
            for the rest of the season. Current Williams test
            driver<b> Jean-Christophe Boullion</b> and factory
            Porsche GT driver <b>Emmanuel Collard </b>were tipped
            as possible replacements. Prost was adamant if a
            little down hearted in Barcelona when he stated
            (probably through gritted teeth) <i>&quot;Shinji is
            going to stay in the team, no problem.&quot;</i> It
            is understood that Mugen would be only too happy to
            give Jordan their power units.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Second choice for
            Honda would be Bennetton who despite rumours of
            having signed with <b>Renault</b> suppliers <b>Mecachrome</b>,
            are still on the prowl for a competitive engine. More
            likely however, would be that <b>Arrows</b>, 99%
            certain to ditch the dreadful Yamaha, would snap up
            the opportunity of an alternative Japanese engine.
            This could be regarded favourably, especially if Hill
            signs for another term of office.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Cosworth Ford
            meanwhile, are considering stopping development on
            the aging Zetec V8 and concentrating their efforts
            solely on the new V10. This would put at least two
            teams out of the picture for next season.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are currently
            more driver rumours than you can shake a stick at.
            Jordan Hot shots Fisichella and Schumacher are both
            due to leave their hot seats for even hotter ones
            according to one German Publication. As <b>Flavio
            Briatore </b>has announced before, Fisichella is one
            of the young italian drivers he fancies for further
            grooming. With the success of Alexander Wurz in
            testing, Flavio seems now to be going the way that <b>Eddie
            Jordan</b> has paved so well and start employing
            &#145;young guns&#146; who are both hungry for
            success and cheaper. Jordan, king of the F1 talent
            spotters, has seen a great many of his signings
            wrested from their contractual obligations, Michael
            Schumacher was filched by Briatore in 1994 and the
            possibility of it happening again with the young
            Italian is not beyond the bounds of impossibility.
            However seeing as Jordan has the hotter of the two
            cars right now, it would seem to be in
            Giancarlo&#146;s interests to stay put. <b>Jarno
            Trulli</b> is another prospective Benetton driver who
            would in fact probably benefit from a change. Seeing
            as Briatore owns the <b>Minardi</b> team for whom
            Trulli drives, that scenario looks more than likely.
            Current driver, Alesi looks set to go to Prost if
            boss <b>Allan Preset</b> can get rid of the Albatross
            called Narkarno, or even back to his old home,
            Jordan. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ralf Schumacher is a
            different kettle of sauerkraut however. It seems that
            the young German&#146;s contract is pretty solid with
            Jordan and a move, Possibly to McLaren, would only
            take place along with a large parcel of money.
            Manager Willi Weber is still talking to Ron Dennis,
            who looks to have two vacant seats at the end of the
            season. <b>West</b>, McLaren&#146;s major sponsor are
            said to be interested in a German driver and again
            the possibility of a move such as this cannot be
            totally ruled out.<b> Jörg Muller</b> was a
            consideration for <b>Mercedes</b> but having recently
            signed as test driver for Arrows he is now out of the
            frame. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Damon Hill, despite
            his renewed vow of confidence in Tom Walkinshaw is
            also linked with Jordan by way of McLaren in a deal
            brokered by West that would effectively trade
            Schumacher junior for the services of the current
            World Champion. The penalty fees paid by West to
            Jordan, would go a long way to pay Hill&#146;s
            probably high asking price.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This leaves Gerhard
            Berger, David Coulthard and Mika Hakkinen with no
            particular place to go but it is likely that, if no
            suitable alternatives appear, they will stay put at
            their team boss&#146; &#145;pleasure&#146; until they
            become redundant.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a nightmare
            scenario, an extremely frightening rumour that Toyota
            may be entering into Formula 1 with Yamaha and <b>Bridgestone,</b>
            is circulating the paddocks. If sponsors are
            desperate enough to throw their money into the all
            Japanese entry, a stone cold loser a best, the team
            could surface in 1999. &#145;Think tank&#146;
            meetings with former Yamaha users Tyrrell and
            Walkinshaw have not so far been discussed.</font></p>

            world rally team were also rumoured to be knocking on

            sponsoring Prodrive with their &#145;555&#146;
            cigarette brand. Having openly admitted to having a
            five year plan to enter Formula 1, they have

            system.</font></p>

            old Boss of the Ockham team, has categorically denied
