            size="2" face="Arial">The unfortunate incident at <i>Luxembourg</i>
            involving the brothers Schumacher, has spoiled what
            might have been a thrilling finale to the 1997 season
            as yet again drawing the short straw, <i>Suzuka</i>
            brings the simmering cauldron of Formula 1 to the
            boil. <b>Williams</b> have shot to the front in the
            constructor&#146;s chase in the past two races and
            their position looks unassailable with a mere six
            points needed out of the forty remaining, the mould
            has gradually formed in the latter half of the
            season, and, in Japan, it is about to be set in
            stone. Those same two races have taken Canadian <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b>, from ten points down, to nine ahead,
            leaving <b>Michael Schumacher</b> the nigh-on
            impossible task of re-establishing <b>Ferrari</b>&#146;s
            early season dominance. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Most doubt that it
            will happen but, Schumacher <i>is</i> Schumacher and
            his end of race sentiments in Luxembourg echo the
            utterances of every driver who has ever been nine
            seconds down on a count of ten in the ring with only
            two rounds to go. <i>&quot;We&#146;ll fight to the
            end.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;You never give up
            whilst it&#146;s mathematically possible to
            win.&quot;</i> As the man standing above him, set to
            raise Villeneuve&#146;s hand aloft when the bell
            clangs, pauses at his calculator to prove him wrong,
            the diminutive Williams driver cannot help but show
            his competitive fangs in a mild gloat. <i>&quot;We&#146;ve
            put 19 points on Michael in two races and I&#146;m
            sure he&#146;ll remember that going to Suzuka.&quot;</i>
            Indeed, that will certainly be at the top of
            Michael&#146;s agenda. But a focused Schumacher is an
            extremely dangerous adversary and as the Japanese
            grand prix has proved over and over again, there will
            be drama, there will be outrage and there probably
            will be a Champion.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Amid the razzmatazz of
            Ferris wheels, swimming pools, hotels, golf courses
            and restaurants at the Motopia amusement park, lies
            the fast and sweeping figure of eight circuit of
            Suzuka. Although only a recent host to Formula 1 it
            has become an important venue for the resolution of
            the drivers&#146; world championship. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Built in 1962 as a
            test track for Honda motorcycles, it was Conceived by
            <i>John Hugenholz</i>, the Dutch engineer who was
            also responsible for the circuit design at <i>Zandvoort</i>
            and <i>Jarama</i>. Suzuka is a mixture of long fast
            corners, power straights and short testing curves and
            is much favoured by drivers who can demonstrate their
            abilities of maintaining maximum momentum whilst
            keeping at bay the nausea caused by the winding
            nature of the track, reversing as it does, its
            clock-wise direction at the tight left hand Hairpin,
            after passing under itself at roughly half distance.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Gary Anderson</b>, <b>Jordan
            Peugeot</b>&#146;s technical director explains it
            thus. <i>&quot;It&#146;s a real drivers circuit, like
            Spa, with corners that flow into each other.&quot;</i>
            He said. <i>&quot;Drivers enjoy this and it will be a
            pleasant change from the &#145;stop start&#146; of
            the last couple of circuits. The balance of the car
            is very important. The track is demanding because you
            have to keep the momentum going throughout the lap.
            Grip levels are reasonable and the downforce is
            medium to high.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Previously held at <i>Mount
            Fuji</i> on two occasions, the third F1 Grand Prix In
            1987 witnessed the culmination of a battle for the
            Championship between <i>Mansell</i> and <i>Piquet</i>
            with a close following <i>Senna</i>. A bad crash in
            Qualifying put Mansell out of the race and while <i>Piquet</i>
            only finished in 15th position, the points gap was
            enough to make it impossible for Mansell to challenge
            at the Final race in Adelaide.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Honda</b> took a
            one - two with <b>McLaren</b> in 1988, <i>Senna</i>
            narrowly pipping Prost not only to the flag but also,
            by three points, to the title. The president of the
            engine empire, Saichiro Honda was there to
            acknowledge the honours for Japan.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1989 saw the
            disintegration of all niceties between Championship
            contenders <i>Prost</i> and <i>Senna</i>. Speculation
            was rife that <i>Prost</i> took <i>Senna</i> out on
            Lap 46 so clinching his third Crown and, adding
            insult to injury, even though <i>Senna </i>won the
            race he was disqualified for taking a short cut after
            his coming together with <i>Prost</i>. Therefore in a
            reversal of roles in 1990, he took what was possibly
            a suicidal inside line on the first corner and wiped
            out the <i>Prost</i>&#146;s chances of clinching the
            title.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another &#145;need to
            win&#146; race by <i>Mansell</i> in 1991was curtailed
            with a spin, so giving Senna his third title also,
            but in a rather vehement post race criticism of
            out-going FIA president, Jean Marie Balestre, he
            openly admitted to running Prost of the road the year
            before to settle the championship. <i>Suzuka</i> had
            once again lived up to its reputation for
            controversy.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A magnanimous if
            rather public gesture by <i>Mansell</i> in 1992, to
            give the winning honours to team mate Patrese - by
            practically stopping on the track in an obviously
            orchestrated manoeuvre to allow the Italian through -
            ended embarrassingly a few laps later with a blown
            engine. The Irony being that Patrese would therefore
            have won anyway.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Violence erupted at
            Suzuka in 1993, with <i>Ayrton Senna</i> striking New
            boy <b>Eddie Irvine</b> for &#145;blocking&#146;
            tactics and, as the 1994 season reached its
            penultimate race, <b>Damon Hill</b> drove
            magnificently in torrential rain to take the win and
            the battle for the World Championship title on to
            Australia.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The downhill race to
            the first corner will be a heart stopper and if the
            Williams or the Ferrari are anywhere near each other
            then it will be the finest of lines between tragedy
            and defeat as one tries to close the door on the
            other.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rumour has it that
            Ferrari have hastily put together a new electronic
            throttle control system that first made its
            appearance - under protest ironically, from the
            Scuderia itself - with McLaren. If it fails and
            it&#146;s reliability is in question, then Schumacher
            has nothing to lose. <b>David Coulthard </b>and more
            recently, <b>Mika Hakinnen</b> have been putting in
            lightening quick getaways and Schumacher&#146;s only
            hope is the speed of the similarly equipped <b>McLarens</b>.
            If they can provide a buffer between the two rivals,
            then there is a chance that Spain will see the
            outcome of the title. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Bridgestone</b>
            have performed well in recent testing at their home
            circuit and could prove to be a helpful hindrance to
            the Williams duo by putting their slower runners
            amongst the points. Also, a few damp minutes before
            the start, or a rainy race could be all the incentive
            Schumacher would need to take those awe inspiring
            risks. The race at Suzuka has been won before by
            drivers putting their bravado to the test where
            others have taken the softer option as <b>Damon Hill</b>
            will recall in 1994.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sadness too, for the
            currant champion, who has watched all his records for
            last year underwritten by his successors. A year like
            1996 will probably not come his way again and it has
            been an inglorious season in which to bathe in his
            well deserved achievement.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the Ferris wheel
            spins and the monorails speed their thrill-seekers to
            points all over the vast amusement park, the irony
            will not be lost on Villeneuve that last year he also
            came to the circuit 9 points down on Champion elect
            Damon Hill. A last chance to capture the crown by
            winning the race was scuppered by a loose nut causing
            a wheel to travel further in the race than he did.
            Williams will not be making that mistake again and,
            if also like last year Schumacher finishes second to
            the Canadian, he will be congratulating a champion
            from the podium for a second year in a row.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is however all
            conjecture. The wonderful thing about Formula 1 this
            year, has been the unexpected, and there are so many
            permutations and twists of fate as to make this race
            result as diverse as the rest have been. Schumacher
            has to keep the points difference at 9 or under to
            take the title to Spain but as they commence their
            final battle, like the Samurais on who&#146;s ancient
            soil they participate, Spain will not be in their
            thoughts. Neither driver has wanted, or needed, a win
            as much and it will be interesting to see which of
            the Warriors, both deserving of Formula 1&#146;s
            grand prize, falls first.</font></p>
