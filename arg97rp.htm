            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was the Dictator
            President <b>Juan Peron</b> who pushed Argentina onto
            the international stage in the late 1940&#146;s and
            early 50&#146;s by lending his name and the name of
            his wife, Eva to the winners&#146; cups. The so
            called <i>Peron Cup races</i> were dominated by one
            Argentinean by the name of Gigi Villoresi and it was
            due to his consistency for winning races that the
            first International racing circuit was built at <b>Buenos
            Aires</b>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Originally built on
            swampland on the outskirts of the city in 1952, the <i>Autodromo
            17 Octobre</i> as it was then called, has now been
            engulfed by the sprawling mass of Buenos Aires. The
            first Argentinean Grand Prix in 1953 was won by <b>Albert
            Ascari</b> and dominated in the following 4 years by <b>Juan
            Manuel</b> <b>Fangio</b>. It was also the first time
            a World Championship had been held outside Europe.
            Argentina, has since become synonymous with the
            greatest racing legends of all time. Past winners
            have included, <b>Stirling Moss</b> (in the first
            rear/mid-engined car, the Cooper Climax) in 1958, <b>Bruce
            McLaren</b> in 1960 and, <b>Emerson Fittipaldi</b> in
            1973, after a 10 year absence of Grand Prix
            activities. <b>Nelson Piquet</b>, then Brazils&#146;
            most favourite home boy, won in 1981 on a badly
            deteriorating track and the Grand Prix was shelved
            until three years ago.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Grand Prix
            returned in 1995 to a drastically modified circuit,
            shortened to just 4.259 kms (2.646 miles) and
            consisting of most of the Southern
            &#145;infield&#146; end. The two extremely long fast
            straights, joined by a sweeping horseshoe at its most
            Northerly point, having been excluded from the rather
            more &#145;intimate&#146; recent configuration. Given
            a new name after the great Argentinean driver, the <b><i>Autodromo
            de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Oscar Alfredo Galvez</i></b>,
            basks amid a thriving and attractive city with wide
            Parisian style boulevards and Grand Napoleonic parks.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Current World Champion
            <b>Damon Hill</b> and top British qualifier at
            Interlagos, has dominated the race since its return,
            in the Williams, but the chance of a hat trick is but
            a distant fantasy for the now <b>Arrows</b>-bound
            driver. However, with the prospect of sudden rain
            storms as in Brazil, and the proneness of the track
            to retain isolated pockets of standing water even as
            the track dries, the much vaunted <b>Bridgestone</b>
            tyres may make a difference in capturing a point or
            two. He has shown true determination and style in
            putting his wayward car on the grid, mere hundreds of
            a second slower than the driver that replaced him at
            Williams, <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b>, who, by all
            accounts is having a miserable time of it with his
            new bosses. <i>(See latest </i><b><i>News update</i></b><i>)</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Prost</b> Driver <b>Olivier
            Panis</b> who did so brilliantly at Interlagos in the
            dry, to finish third, may score some major points
            again and possibly a win if the weather proves foul.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Goodyear</b> in
            retaliation, are taking over 2300 tyres to the race
            of which slightly over half are choices of dry
            compounds. The 1997 Argentine Grand Prix will also
            mark the 100th appearance of the Jordan Team who
            debuted in Phoenix USA in March 1991. Team Manager, <b>Eddie
            Jordan</b> has fond memories of the team's first
            Grand Prix. <i>&quot;Our first Formula One race
            nearly took place on St Patrick's Day, and I had
            fantastic visions of our green car driving through
            the streets in America.&quot; </i>He added,<i> &quot;
            For me, our 100th Grand Prix marks the beginning of
            this new era where we will see the Grand Prix
            victories we have craved for so long.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Benetton</b> are
            back on form having finally learned how to set up
            their new car. <b>Gerhard Berger</b> especially could
            be in line for another podium finish. Technical
            Director <b>Pat Symonds</b> said after a successful
            practice session with <b>Jean Alesi</b> at
            Silverstone last week, <i>&quot;Following better
            results in Brazil, we have progressed through planned
            a development programme and are very satisfied with
            the results.&quot; </i>PR-speak of course, but not
            without credence it would appear.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Driver <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b> has been putting his <b>Ferrari</b>
            through its paces and creating fresh lap records at
            their home circuit at Mugello, but he doesn&#146;t
            realistically expect to get to the podium. There
            could however, be a remote possibility that <b>Eddie
            Irvine</b> in the second Ferrari might, just might
            get through the first lap without hitting something.
            This would indeed be a small victory for the team in
            itself.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One should expect
            great things from the recently rejuvenated <b>West
            McLaren Mercedes</b> team. Yet after winning the race
            in Melbourne <b>David Coulthard</b> has been backward
            in coming forward, whilst team mate <b>Mika Hakkinen</b>
            has been forward in standing still maintaining an
            even 3rd and 4th to date.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With some good
            performances now expected from a fast up and coming <b>Jarno
            Trulli</b> in the <b>Minardi</b> and Brazilian <b>Rubens
            Barichello</b> desperate to finish a race for <b>Stewart</b>,
            the chequered flag will surely fall on the Williams
            of <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b>, pipped at the post by a
            little over 12 seconds last year, partly due to his
            lack of track experience. <i>&quot;It was only my
            third Grand Prix,&quot;</i> Villeneuve said, <i>&quot;I&#146;m
            looking forward to returning with prior knowledge and
            experience of the circuit. The car is very strong,
            the team is working really well, the tyres and engine
            are fine, so I&#146;m pretty confident.&quot;</i>
            That&#146;s enough to make most drivers head straight
            for the <i>&#145;parc ferme&#146;</i> without passing
            go and it&#146;s a statement that even the most
            ardent pessimist could not dispute.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A creative gambling
            man however, may like to weigh up the odds, add some
            rain, a change of rubber, check out &#145;between
            race&#146; testing times and the determination of
            several drivers to do well, to see that Villeneuve in
            different circumstances, would not necessarily be the
            odds on favourite. It could also depend on where
            Irvine qualifies.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Argentinean Grand
            Prix takes place over 72 laps on a slippery and
            narrow track which has scarcely any overtaking
            opportunities. As in Monaco a good grid position and
            the ability to capitalise on it is vitally important.
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the long
            Grandstand, amid the vociferous and animated Latin <i>aficionados</i>
            sits the ghost of <b>Eva Peron</b> and her Dictator
            Husband, once guarded by heavily armed soldiers
            who&#146;s proliferation at strategic parts of the
            circuit always cast a shadow over the events. The
            last great Argentinean <b>Carlos Reutemann</b> never
            won his home Grand Prix and there is little to look
            forward to in the near future. But Argentina will not
            cry for the fans this weekend. No one has won more
            times than their God, Fangio and as Peron presides,
            Fangio&#146;s spirit will be down on the track
            somewhere urging on the gallant and bravehearted to
            taste the spoils of victory.</font></p>
