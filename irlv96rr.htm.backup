<h2 align=center>Race Report </h2>
<p align=left>Richie Hearn, of Cayon Country California, driving the Della Penna Motorsports 
Ralphs Food4Less Reynard 95I-Ford, won the Las Vegas 500K at the Las Vegas 
Motor Speedway on Sunday (15th Spet 1996) - round two of the 1996-1997 Indy 
Racing League. </p>
<p align=left>Hearn took the lead from Robby Gordon thirty-two laps from the finish to record his 
maiden IRL victory. </p>
<p align=left>In all, Hearn led ninety laps. His first stint at the front of the field coming on the half 
distance lap. An action packed race, filled with nine caution periods kept his winning 
average speed down to just 115.171 mph. </p>
<p align=left>Michel Jourdain Jnr., driving a Lola-Ford finished a superb second with Mike Groff 
third. </p>
<p align=left>Pole winner Arie Luyendyk, Gordon, John Paul Jnr., Hearn and Johnny O'Connell 
swapped the lead ten times during the two hundred lap race, two of those mentioned 
exiting the race in dramatic style... </p>
<p align=left>Luyendyk, leader for the first twenty-five laps, crashed heavily in Turn 2 shortly after 
the halfway mark. His Mi-Jack/Bryant Heating and Cooling Special Reynard 
95I-Ford was badly damaged, but the 1990 Indianapolis 500 winner escaped 
unharmed. </p>
<p align=left>Johnny O'Connell, Luyendyk's team-mate, was fortunate to escape without serious 
injury following a high speed crash in Turn 4. O'Connell's car hit the concrete wall at 
over 220mph sending debri into the air. O'Connell's car then proceeded to skid for 
nearly 500 yards upside down, only for the resident of Chandler, Arizona, to climb 
out much to the relief and cheers of the huge 67,000+ crowd. </p>
<p align=left>The red-flag was displayed while corner workers cleared the track, and once the race 
was re-started Hearn sprinted for victory. </p>
<p align=left>&quot;The game plan was to run like the Indy 500,&quot; Hearn said, &quot;we decided to take an 
Indy 500 approach and be conservative. Our car was working very very well. I knew 
once I got the lead I could run flat out.&quot; </p>
<p align=left>Other drivers to be involved in accidents included Hemelgarn Racing's Brad 
Murphey, Glidden-Menard duo Tony Stewart and Mark Dismore, and McCormack 
Motorsport's Stan Wattles. </p>
<p align=left>Former rodeo ride, Brad Murphey, was taken to hospital with a broken thigh. Tony 
Stewart's Turn 2 incident left him with back and shoulder injuries, while Mark 
Dismore left the trackside with a suspected broken hip. </p>
<p align=left>Stan Wattles was also removed to hospital following his Turn 4 crash which left him 
unconscious in the car for a short while. All drivers are now recovering and hope to 
be back behind the wheel of an Indianapolis type car as soon as possible. </p>
