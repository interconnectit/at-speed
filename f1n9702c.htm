        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The past six days saw the
        final testing session for the <b>Jordan Peugeot </b>team,
        <b>Ralf Schumacher</b> starting off last Friday with <b>Giancarlo
        Fisichella</b> commencing Saturday. This was the first
        time that the team have tested the two 197&#146;s
        concurrently. Early wet conditions prevented any
        worthwhile contributions and later engine problems
        prevented Schumacher from testing. Saturday afternoon
        enabled Fisichella to complete a few installation runs in
        what was his cars first outing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sunday morning was spent
        evaluating new specification wet tyres from <b>Goodyear</b>
        and in the afternoon despite further engine problems for
        Schumacher, both drivers went out on slicks, Fisichella
        setting second fastest time of the day (1.22.16). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dry weather Monday enabled
        Ralf Schumacher to complete a full race distance but
        small technical problems plagued the team and it
        wasn&#146;t until Wednesday, the final day of testing
        that Fisichella was able to complete his full distance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Gary Anderson</b>,
        Technical director, commented today that the test had
        been a success. &quot;I am very happy with the general
        running of the car and the performance of our Goodyear
        tyres. I feel that it was a very positive test,
        particularly as we did all the running with race fuel.
        After sorting out a few niggling problems, it was good
        for both Peugeot and ourselves to achieve two full race
        distance runs as well.&quot; The team will be testing at

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>(11th Feb 1997)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a rather cryptic press
        release </font><a href="fe97sp.htm"><font size="2"
        face="Arial"><b>Ferrari</b></font></a><font size="2"
        face="Arial"> today announced that it was in effect
        handing over the <b>Ferrari Design &amp; Development</b>
        facilities to it&#146;s soon to become ex Designer, <b>John
        Barnard</b>. The statement concluded, &quot;The
        facilities will continue to operate totally and
        autonomously in respect of Ferrari, in the field of
        specialist design and manufacture. Subject to final
        agreement, it is the parties intention to implement this
        project within the next two months.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Far from being downbeat,
        Barnard told the press that it was exactly what he had
        intended in his original agreement with Ferrari.
        Barnard&#146;s refusal to work in Italy and the desire of
        Ferrari to consolidate its efforts for a World
        Constructors Championship at <b>Maranello</b>, not to
        mention their misgiving about the last two Barnard
        designed cars, are thought to be the key reasons for the
        split.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the further
        re-location of Benetton personnel to the Scuderia
        (Technical director <b>Ross Brawn</b> and Designer <b>Rory
        Byrne</b>) it seems that <b>Michael Schumacher </b>is
        tailoring his old crew to fit his Championship
        aspirations and a cool relationship between himself and
        Barnard may not have suited his purposes. This is of
        course conjecture. Barnard says that &quot;We will
        continue to manufacture for Ferrari and we are looking at
        various design programmes&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With an impending
        association with the Newly formed<b> Prost Grand Prix</b>
        team rumoured, it is difficult to see how Barnard can
        indeed wear two hats with impartiality but,
        &#145;aerodynamic changes are coming&#146;, he said. His
        contract with Ferrari expires in July.</font></p>

        LIGIER</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>(14th Feb 1997)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It had to be the most
        bandied-about rumour in Formula one and it was finally
        announced in a curt press release from the FIA announcing
        that it had granted Alan Prost permission to change the
        name of Ligier to his own. This simple statement hid a
        landslide of pre season negotiations between Engine
        suppliers, French Government officials and Team owners.
        The tip of the iceberg is that Alan Prost is the proud
        owner of the now renamed Ligier team and from 1998 has a
        three year non exclusive deal with engine supplier,
        Peugeot. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Peugeot, currently in the
        final year of an exclusive supply deal to the <b>Benson
        and Hedges Total Jordan Peugeot</b> team were obviously
        interested in an all French team. Reticent to associate
        themselves with the political leanings of former owner <b>Guy
        Ligier</b>, a supply deal could only be struck if Prost
        agreed to change it&#146;s name to his. This would also
        guarantee world wide media attention with a four times
        world champion at the helm. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first fly in the
        ointment was the <b>F1 Concorde agreement</b> whereby
        anything affecting the F1 community as a whole, has to be
        agreed by all signatories. The second fly was a rather
        anxious <b>Eddie Jordan</b> up against it to produce some
        exceptional results for Peugeot this year after a
        fruitless two year association. Hoping that, with a
        positive season under his belt and the regained goodwill
        of Peugeot, he might retain his exclusive deal. This
        seemed highly unlikely, yet without Jordan&#146;s
        signature joining the others, Prost and Peugeot were in a
        stalemate position. The situation finally changed however
        on Wednesday (12th) when Jordan finally gave in and
        signed after being told by Peugeot that they would
        definitely supply two teams next year. A statement issued
        by Jordan established that the engine supply to the team
        was an &#145;on-going issue&quot;. Jordan is by no means
        guaranteed the Engine supply next year. However, as all
        the machinations are in place and provided that the
        Jordan Peugeot team can produce some encouraging results,
        there is no reason why they could not become wary
        bedmates with Prost Grand Prix in sharing the same
        supply. Prost said of Jordan at his announcement of the
        deal in Paris last Friday, &quot;Without his
        authorisation we could not sign the deal and I really
        thank him, because he understood that from the beginning
        it was also good for Formula 1&quot; </font></p>

        size="2" face="Arial"> fold for the next few years (see
        earlier <b>Speed Motorsport News</b> update) and Ligier
        changing to Peugeot for the 1998 season and beyond, it is
        not inconceivable that engine suppliers to Formula one
        could be weaving a merry dance of musical chairs come
        &#145;Driver swoppsy&#146; time at <b>Monza</b>. <b>Flavio
        Briatore,</b> head of the Benetton team, sharing the same
        engine with Williams, and fully expecting to lose his
        Renault Power along with Williams when they announced
        their retirement from the sport, now finds himself able
        to renegociate a deal with Renault developer <b>Mecachrome</b>.
        However it is believed that he has been wooing <b>Mugen
        Honda</b> in the light of the former Ligier teams switch
        to Peugeot next year. Briatore with several financial
        fingers in both Benetton and Prost (formerly Ligier)
        pies, is expected to do the right thing and sign with
        Honda to supply his Benetton cars. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This leaves Renault with a
        single customer shortage. Whilst no one in their right
        minds would turn down the opportunity of sticking one of
        those mercurial bits of metal behind their drivers, it is
        by no means a forgone conclusion that Mecachrome, in
        close consultation with Renault, would sell their engines
        to just any team. <b>Sauber </b>are in bed now with
        Ferrari, Tyrell and Stewart are happy so far with Ford
        and <b>McLaren </b>are tight with<b> Mercedes</b>. The
        only team that desperately needs an engine that works,
        like Santa needs a sleigh to deliver presents, is <b>TWR</b>.
        The <b>Yamaha </b>they are currently running has proved
        so unreliable in testing that it seems doubtful whether
        they will finish any of their races this year. With <b>Damon
        Hill</b> a knowledgeable user of the Renault engine and
        an excellent test driver in his own right, and the money
        that team owner <b>Tom Walkenshaw</b> could probably put
        up, would make an interesting scenario for Mecachrome, to
        power his team back to the forefront of the game. It also
        has to be noted that Williams were rumoured to be in
        touch with former F1 supplier <b>BMW</b> who have stated
        that it would be at least two years before they could be
        ready to enter the fray. This could still be the case as
        the ever shrewd Boss <b>Frank Williams</b> is cementing
        his German credentials with last year&#146;s signing of
        Heinz-Harald Frentzen and, who knows, when Michael
        Schumacher gets tired of Ferrari, or even his brother
        Ralf, coming to the end of his contract at Jordan, to
        make it a double German line up by the time BMW is ready.
        Team performances by mid season should give a clear
        indication as to where these engines will go next year.</font></p>

        testing at Estoril with <b>Heinz-Harald Frentzen</b>
        topping the times. It was fairly predictable that it
        would be a Williams that would break all the records and
        following Frentzen&#146;s time of 1.18.68, team mate <b>Jacques
        Villeneuve</b> in the other Williams, posted second
        fastest, with a record time of 1.18.36 on the previous
        day.</font></p>

        CASE </b>(c) 1997 Agence France-Presse </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>(Feb 20, 1997)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The trial of <b>Frank
        Williams</b> on manslaughter charges over the death of
        the Brazilian motor racing champion <b>Ayrton Senna</b>
        was threatened with collapse the moment it opened
        yesterday (Thursday, February 20) when a lawyer for an
        accused member of the Williams Formula One team claimed
        the prosecution had &quot;scandalously&quot; failed to
        observe legal procedures.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Professor<b> Luigi
        Stortoni</b>, representing <b>Adrian Newey</b>, the
        Williams team chief designer, told a stunned courtroom
        that Newey had never been told he was under investigation
        -- as required by Italian law -- and had been questioned
        five months after Senna's death during the <b>San Marino
        Grand Prix</b> in May 1994 &quot;as a witness, not as a
        suspect, without the presence of a lawyer.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Newey's evidence was
        therefore inadmissable and the charges against him should
        be dropped. Lawyers representing Williams and <b>Patrick
        Head</b>, his technical director, said that if the judge
        threw out the charges against Newey the whole case
        against both the Williams team and Imola track directors
        could crumble. &quot;Newey gave evidence on the re-welded
        steering wheel, which the prosecution says was the cause
        of Senna's death,&quot; <b>Oreste Dominioni</b>,
        Williams's Italian lawyer, told the court. &quot;If his
        evidence is withdrawn, the whole of the 500-page
        technical report is compromised.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">None of the Williams team
        attended yesterday's hearing. Williams &quot;might
        appear&quot; at a later hearing next month when Signor
        Passarini presents his case. <b>Damon Hill</b>, the
        reigning champion, was among 44 witnesses named
        yesterday.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Trial was adjourned
        until the 28th of Feb.</font></p>
