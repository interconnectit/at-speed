            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It now looks like Team
            boss <b>Frank Williams</b>, technical director <b>Patrick
            Head</b> and other sundry Williams personnel will
            most definitely be charged with manslaughter in the Italian
            courts, for the Death of <b>Ayrton Senna</b>. If
            convicted they could face a prison sentence of up to
            seven years but it is expected that should a guilty
            verdict be drawn a 2 year suspended sentence would be
            most likely. As reported in <b><i>&#145;Speed&#146; </i></b>earlier,
            most teams would expect to participate in a boycott
            of all Italian events. Boss of Benetton, <b>Flavio Briatore</b>,
            stated that he would not race in a country that can
            convict you for an accident in a sport where fatality
            is part of the game.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a recent interview
            with Reporter Russell Bulgin, <b>Viviane Senna</b>,
            Ayrton&#146;s sister and President of the Ayrton
            Senna Foundation, said: &#145; To find who was the
            guilty party won&#146;t change anything. Whatever the
            result, it won&#146;t bring Ayrton back. I don&#146;t
            think Williams were solely responsible&#146;. The word
            &#145;solely&#146; seems to indicate that there is
            the belief in her mind that someone is to blame. This
            indeed seems strangely at odds with the opinion of
            her brother, who, had he been able to comment on his
            own demise, would probably have shrugged his
            shoulders and called it a racing accident. The world
            now waits to see whether Ferrari will ever get
            another chance to win a home Grand Prix.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile the Williams
            FW16 that Senna died in, is still being held by the
            Italians who have allowed the Williams team only a
            cursory examination since the accident. There appears
            to be no chance of the car being released to the team
            at any time before the trial.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Nigel
            Mansell&#146;s</b> much publicised testing session
            for Jordan-Peugeot turned into a bit of a damp squib
            last Wednesday as the Ex World Champion failed to
            prove to the assembled international media that he
            was up to the job. Finishing the session on a damp
            track four seconds slower than fastest man <b>Jacques
            Villeneuve</b> and four tenths of a second slower
            than his potential team mate, rookie Ralph Schumacher.
            The following day on an even wetter track he was down
            to almost a second and a half adrift. On both days he
            was the slowest man in the field. Since the Jordan Peugeot
            car has never been a front runner it would have been
            a spectacular occurrence had he trounced the field. This
            brought up the query as to why Mansell would want to return
            to Formula 1 in a second string car.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Michael Schumacher</b>
            recently warned Mansell of the boredom factor in not
            being competitive. But after 18 months &#145;out of
            the saddle&#146; his times appeared to please him and
            he said that &#145;It was a wonderful experience and
            over the next few days we will be considering our
            future&#146;. Quite who the other person was, no one
            seemed to know. <b>Eddie Jordan</b> was also
            cautiously optimistic about Mansells turn of speed but
            wary of his commitment at the age of 43, to a full
            race season. &#145;It is up to him&#146;. Said
            Jordan, &#145;he still has the basic skills, but as
            to his commitment for 17 races, that&#146;s a question
            only he can answer.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the end of the day,
            as Mansell flew back to Devon at his own expense in
            his private plane, there weren&#146;t many in the pit
            lane who felt imminently threatened. The biggest grin
            was on the mouth of Brazilian <b>Pedro Diniz</b> the
            recently recruited number two driver for the TWR
            Arrows team. Driving the &#146;96 Arrows-Hart, a dog
            by even the Jordan&#146;s standards, with 60 kilos of
            fuel and 500RPM less than in racing trim to save on engines,
            he managed to better Mansell&#146;s time by almost
            two tenths of a second.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It&#146;s all a
            question of motivation. Why Mansell should want to come
            back, is the burning question. He has nothing to
            prove and he is not short of cash. To let his ego
            rule his head would not be implausible but to drive
            for a second string team could damage that
            irretrievably. The pundits watering themselves at the
            19th hole at Mansells Devonshire golf club have
            another theory. It&#146;s to do with the roar of the
            crowd. There isn&#146;t a lot of that in Golf and no
            matter which set of wheels takes him past the
            Chequered flag in whatever position, his
            &#145;comfort zone&#146; would be considerably heightened
            by his old adoring crowd returning in their thousands
            to see their Hero back in action.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The FIA World
            Council </b>introduced several significant changes to
            the rules for Formula 1 for the 1998 season. Whilst
            tyres are to remain unchanged in width, they are to be
            scribed with circumferential grooves to effectively
            lessen the amount of rubber contact with the track
            hence reducing grip. The grooves (three on the front
            and four on the rear) are to be 14mm wide, narrowing
            to 10mm at a depth of 2.5mm. They will be central on
            the tyre and 50mm apart. In an effort to encourage
            more frequent tyre changes during racing, at least
            50% of the total groove must still be visible after
            use, unless the absence is due to abnormal wear
            caused by car damage.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Exotic materials such
            as aluminium-basilicum compounds and aluminium and
            ceramic powder composites that govern the rigidity of
            brake calipers are effectively being banned by introducing
            specific caliper stiffness figures. Along with a one
            caliper/one disc and two pad rule for each wheel,
            these measures should put the breaking power back in
            the drivers&#146; legs rather than the pedals that
            they press.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The maximum width of
            cars will be reduced to 1800mm from 2000mm so making
            the car less stable and therefore slower through
            corners. These measures, according to <b>Patrick Head</b>
            Williams<em> </em>technical director, could cut
            downforce by at least 20%. However, despite the
            general nod in the direction of increased race
            safety, it was mentioned that in a critical dry/wet
            race, cars may be tempted to stay out a little longer before
            pitting for wet rubber, due to the added grip that
            the grooves on slick tyres might afford. According to
            source close to FIA technical delegate <b>Charlie
            Whiting</b> (who becomes new Race Director and Safety
            Delegate for the coming season) &#145;there is little
            or no added advantage in running grooved tyres in wet
            conditions&#146;.</font></p>

            Prix date has been changed to allow engine
            manufacturer Renault Sport to have their final Grand Prix
            in Europe. This is a token of gratitude and respect
            from <b>Bernie Ecclestone</b> F1&#146;s Media boss,
            for the contribution that Renault have given to the
            sport over the past 20 years. Next year also gives
            Germany the unfair advantage of having three Grands
            prix to their name at Hockenheim, Nurburgring and the
            A-1 ring in Austria. Whilst the latter is not
            strictly German it is considered to be an important
            trio of races due to the increased awareness by
            Teutonic racing fans of the two Schumachers and the
            new super fast <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen. </b>Of
            course it never entered Ecclestone&#146;s head that for
            the past two or three years there have been at times,
            up to seven British formula 1 drivers competing and
            never less than four. So how many European Grands
            Prix have been held in the UK? Donnington was the
            last in 1993. Digital TV in Germany has filled his
            coffers to the brim and it is now imperative that he
            should give them as many opportunities as possible in
            which to exploit its commercial potential.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">London saw the launch
            last week of a brand new car to a brand new team. The <b>Stewart
            Grand Prix Team</b> revealed its first born in rather
            understated manner. A derivative of the high-nosed
            cars of &#146;96, <b>Jackie Stewart</b>, Chairman is
            hoping for consistent midfield qualifying. With £100
            million pounds invested in them by Ford over the next
            five years and with sponsorship from The Hong Kong
            &amp; Shanghai Bank, Texaco and Japanese giant Sanyo,
            the white car with the Tartan ribbon wrapping, looks
            set to become a permanent fixture. However Stewart is
            still looking for further Sponsorship. The car is yet
            to turn a wheel, but to check whether designer<b> Alan
            Jenkins </b>got his programming and sums right, it
            will be tested at an undisclosed location before
            Christmas. This is as much for tyre manufacturers
            Bridgestone&#146;s benefit as SGP&#146;s. Jenkins
            said &#145;..we came in at the highest level we could
