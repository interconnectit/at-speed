            school&#146;s out</strong>, and the boys are on their
            holidays. The hampers are packed, the private jets
            and helicopters have whisked their frazzled passengers
            to all the more expensive parts of the globe and
            whilst the lads are bent on a bit of R &amp; R before
            taking up their new duties as captains of different houses
            or indeed different schools, it&#146;s time to send
            out the reports. A+&#146;s for some, D&#146;s and
            E&#146;s for others. On the whole, it&#146;s been a
            good year, most of the class acquitting themselves
            extremely well. Discipline at times could have been
            improved but the overall sense of team spirit has
            been prevalent and it is good to see the petty
            wranglings of the class of &#146;95 put behind us.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Star
            pupil of course is Damon Hill</strong>, first time a
            World Champion and not through want of trying. Having
            crawled towards the end of 1995 a partly broken man,
            he salvaged the remnants of that year to take the
            last race win in Adelaide and, working on a small but
            bright spark of positive energy, came into the 1996
            season a different man. Fit, lean and mentally alert,
            he had a point to prove and by the close of play in
            Japan he proved it. The &#145;nearly man&#146; , the
            man who finished third behind Head boy Senna, and
            Prost, the Professor in &#146;93 and second behind
            Class Prefect, Michael Schumacher for two consecutive
            years, followed the curve of his own graph and
            achieved his goal, although the points along that
            jagged line would reveal that it had not by any means,
            been a walk over.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>New
            boy Jacques Villeneuve</strong>, fresh from his Championship
            in Indy car racing, was the surprise of the opening
            race at the new Australian venue in Melbourne. The betting
            that Villeneuve could possibly wrest the crown in his first
            season from early favourite Hill, was by no means far fetched
            as, having set the first pole of the year, he
            proceeded to dominate the race until an oil leak
            forced him to concede victory to his team mate. The
            race wasn't about the winning, it was about the
            coming second and it was clear to all that '96 would
            see a new Braveheart to rattle the cages of the slightly
            more established pretenders to the throne.</font><img

            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>O</strong></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>At
            a rainy Interlagos circuit in Brazil</strong>, it was the
            Williams that shone again with Hill putting an indelible
            stamp on the race from the pole he took the previous
            day, to the flag. Rubens Barichello also impressed
            but failed to gain a podium finish in front of his home
            crowd when he spun on the 59th lap. Jean Alesi was the
            only driver in competition with Hill during the race.
            Having played Villeneuve at his own game in a
            decidedly over optimistic passing manoeuvre, he left
            the Canadian spinning uncontrollably into the gravel.
            A born wet weather driver and an addicted risk taker,
            there was no fear in Alesi's cockpit as he strove to
            gain time on the leader, despite being told in no uncertain
            terms by his team, that after his ungainly exit in Melbourne,
            he was to finish the race at all costs. This he did just
            17 seconds behind race winner Hill with a lapped Schumacher
            driving the as yet undeveloped Ferrari to third place
            and it's first points of the season.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>O</strong></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>With
            an improving Ferrari in Buenos Aires</strong>,
            Schumacher managed to keep to the tail of Hill who
            was on another charge despite going through a bout of
            'Continental Tummy'. With the airing of the Safety
            car for the first time, after the Forti Ford of Luca
            Badoer did a somersault on lap 24, the mid field
            changed. Villeneuve having closed up from his lowly ninth
            of the grid to fifth was able to stay in touch with
            the leaders. Yet luck was to go his way as
            Schumacher's Ferrari, hit by debris from Badoer's
            Forti, and thrown up by Hill's Williams, retired with
            a damaged wing. The Benetton of Berger suffering a
            suspension problem and Alesi's prolonged stay in the
            pits due to him stalling the engine gave Villeneuve the
            ideal opportunity to make the best of a trying day
            and make it the first of 5, one/two's for the
            Williams team. Cause for concern about re-fueling was
            again bought into focus by the potentially horrific
            fire in Diniz' Ligier caused by a stuck fuel valve.
            This happened whilst the safety car was out and could
            have been disastrous had their been other cars close by
            in a race situation. Diniz' escaped his baptism by
            fire unscathed but probably fairly shaken.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The
            European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring</strong> heard
            the unfamiliar strains of the Canadian National
            anthem, played for the first time at a race in
            fifteen years. New boy Jacques Villeneuve, playing in
            the 'Battle of the Backmarkers' acquitted himself
            well against the onslaught and pressure of Michael
            Schumacher who, try as he may never managed to rattle
            the ex-Indy racer, who was, as he said rather coolly later,
            'only doing my job!'. After a bad start Hill was
            never really in contention. Coulthard however had
            made a blinding start from sixth place to follow
            Vuilleneuve into the first corner and again Benetton
            falling even further from grace with the Gods of
            Formula 1 had both drivers dragging their tails on
            the grid with jammed hand brakes. Less than a second separated
            Villeneuve and Schumacher at the flag and 30 odd seconds
            down the line Hill trailed Coulthard over the line at the
            same distance after making a final lunge for a podium finish.
            Coulthard new Hill from being his teammate at Williams
            the previous year and knew that recklessness was not
            part of Hill's Championship strategy. He would sit
            behind the McLaren and take the 3 points offered.
            Mika Hakkinen was forced to take two stop-go
            penalties, both for pit lane speeding, but justly
            deserved House colours flew for the red and white
            cars. Ron Dennis knew that his cars had a future.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>O</strong></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The
            future it seemed lay</strong>, at San Marino at least
            with Coulthard who made an even better start from the
            fourth row, to lead Hill into Tamburello. School
            bully Alesi had again decided that Villeneuve was not
            going to be allowed to race and not content with
            hitting him once, he went back for good measure
            destroying his left rear tyre. A caning was undoubtedly
            due from Form master Flavio Briatore even before he
            was given a stop-go penalty for pit lane speeding and
            was lucky indeed to manage a single point at the
            finish. It was fortunate that his teammate Berger
            managed a podium position as it possibly tempered the
            post race dressing down that a fuming Briatore was
            going to bestow on both boys. As usual pit stop
            strategies sorted most of the race order and by close
            of play it was Hill that passed the line over 6
            seconds clear of Schumacher. Eleventh place did
            little to justify an heroic drive by Villeneuve and
            Coulthard after the promise of points retired his
            McLaren with hydraulic pressure loss on lap 44.
            Whilst Williams still had the strongest arm, the
            Ferrari in the hands of Schumacher, was rapidly
            becoming the second car to beat. Martin Brundle,
            despite Eddie Jordan's high expectations was not
            proving a hard grafter with only one point , three
            spins and an accident to show for the end of the spring
            term.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>If
            one could have bet successfully on the outcome of the
            race at Monaco</strong>, one could have become a
            millionaire. In a race of attrition from the start we
            saw all the contenders dropping by the wayside as the
            race unfolded. The toll started with Schumacher,
            barrier bound on the first lap and willingly
            admitting his mistake. Hill's dominating position ahead
            of Alesi by a country mile, ended
            uncharacteristically with a blown engine the first of
            several that Renault were to suffer in the coming
            races races. This gave Alesi the green light until
            broken springs put him out of the running. Villeneuve,
            having a bad weekend was never in the running and
            Luca Badoer saw to it that he would not complete the race
            by cutting him up at the Mirabeau. Williams zero
            points. It was a rather dazed and confused Olivier
            Panis who took the flag fending off the McLaren of
            Coulthard in the final laps and providing Ligier with
            it first win since 1981. In one of the highest
            incident filled races of all time, only three cars completed
            the course and it was to herald the start of the doubts
            and insecurities that Hill was to experience in his uphill
            battle from there on, to the drivers crown.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>One
            of the finest drives of the year</strong>, by
            Schumacher, was to mark the Spanish Grand Prix in
            Barcelona. Hill on a marginal wet/dry setup could not
            come to grips with his car and after two spins,
            managed to get it right on the third and put himself
            out of the race. A briefly leading Alesi was passed
            by the Ferrari Serene as a luxury liner ploughing through
            the sea and at one point Captain Schumacher was gaining
            over the field by 4 seconds a lap. This despite the V10
            firing on less than its full compliment of cylinders
            gave him the win by a healthy 55 seconds over the
            Frenchman's Benetton.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>A
            home victory was to be denied Villeneuve</strong> in
            the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal. Media attention
            to the son of the great Gilles, the novelty of a home
            boy in with the loudest shout and pole position must
            have put a certain amount of pressure on him to
            perform. Both Williams ran one/two for the duration
            of the race, the Ferrari threat virtually eliminated
            at the start when Schumacher stalled and was forced
            to take up position at the rear of the pack. His pit
            stop on lap 41 was to be Ferrari's undoing literally
            as the force of Schumacher's acceleration away from
            the pits produced a clanking trail of engine
            entrails, most importantly the drive half shaft. He
            wasn't going anywhere. Hill took the flag in what
            most pundits saw as a dull race. But, non the less
            with a valuable 10 points added to his total after a
            two race void, he felt himself back on course for the
            Championship. Villeneuve's strike rate though, as yet
            unspectacular, was showing and the next few races
            would reveal the true battle ahead.</font></p>

            behind giving the engine manufacture a resounding 1
            to 4 victory in it's home country. Schumacher's
            Ferrari saw fit to let go on the parade lap of all places,
            followed shortly by team mate Eddie Irvine's gearbox on
            the fifth lap and the resultant howling of the
            Italian press to give Jean Todt the Team Captain, the
            'heave ho', was only defused by the unswerving
            support that Schumacher gave to the team. Another one
            two for Williams and the Constructors' Crown looked
            inevitable.</font></p>

            face="Arial"><strong>Having lost to Hill at his own
            Grand Prix</strong>, it was Villeneuve's chance to
            turn the table and take what was universally thought
            to be the Englishman's right of passage at Silverstone.
            Despite thrilling the crowd with a last minute pole
            grabbing lap the day before he made what was to be
            the first of a trio of dreadful starts and having got bogged
            down in the second string pack, never made it beyond
            fourth place before spinning out with a loose front wheel.
            This was not apparent at the time and it was an embarrassed
            Hill who had to fend off the commiserations of the
            British Journalists until the fault was proved not to
            be his. It was Villeneuve's day however, again helped
            by the untimely exit of Schumacher's Ferrari with yet
            another pressure leak. The chasing Alesi was once
            more out of the running with a seized wheel bearing
            leaving Berger to take the honours for Benetton on
            the second step. The ever improving McLarens gave
            Hakkinen a well deserved third and Coulthard fifth.
            Both Jordans too, made it to the points with
            Barichello's highest showing of the season in 4 th
            position yet despite Bundle's optimism for his
            rejuvenated driving capacities, a fourth at Monza and
            a fifth at Suzuka were to be his only high points of
            the season.</font></p>

            and within three laps of the flag leading Hill and

            season in a spectacular cloud of white smoke. Hill
            could not show his delight at inheriting the podium,
            acknowledging Bergers great drive and poor luck, but
            thinking back to Monaco and possibly his right to a reversal
            of fortune. It was obvious that his Williams was a
            tad quicker than the Benetton but debatable as to
            whether he would have passed Berger in the three laps
            remaining, both having the same Renault power. A bold
            passing manoeuvre by Villeneuve, but a mere taster of
            things to come in Estoril, gave Villeneuve third
            place behind Alesi, Schumacher coming in a distant
            fourth with Coulthard again showing strongly, snapping
            at his heels. The points gap between the two Williams
            drivers was 21 points and things looked good for Hill in
            the run up to the final races. It was wise of him not
            to count chickens to early as it turned out.</font><img

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Despite
            pole position</strong>, it was another dark day for
            the Ferrari team with Irvine's gearbox failing on lap
            31 and Schumacher retiring seven laps from the finish
            with similar problems. Berger again making the better
            of running of the two Benettons and with a probable
            third place in the bag, was stunned beyond belief
            when again his engine expired spectacularly. The Gods were
            definitely against him and it was a fortunate Alesi
            who took 4 points for his team. From championship
            team and Constructors winners, they were struggling
            to find any of their previous form which said
            mountains for the skills of former driver Schumacher,
            who even when viewed from the garage, or the side of
            the track in a Ferrari that seemed to be more stationary
            than not, still carried the mantle of a Motor racing giant.
            A botched pit stop for Villeneuve brought the two Williams
            together for the end of the race, Hill not quite
            having the power or the nerve to attempt to overtake
            his team mate on a circuit notorious for its lack of
            passing places. He settled for 2nd, losing a further
            four points to his only championship rival.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>O</strong></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The
            rain threatened but never came</strong>, despite an
            earlier downpour leaving the track in a dampish state
            for the start of the Belgium Grand Prix. Hill made
            his customary poor start, Villeneuve roaring away
            leading Schumacher through at La Source. Hill,
            driving the spare car after an earlier spin, and suffering
            severe understeer was also passed by Coulthard out of
            Eau Rouge and was to say later: &quot;He came up
            behind me and just came straight past - I wasn't able
            to do anything about it. ...his performance (through
            Les Combes) was quite impressive. &quot; Hill
            continued to lose ground to Coulthard and on the same
            lap was over 4 seconds down on the leader. Back at la
            Source mayhem was breaking out. Herbert, in a short
            aerial solo, launched himself from the rear wheels of Heinz
            Harold's car and put paid to any dreams Sauber may have
            had for a finish of any kind. Immediately prior to
            that, Irvine it seemed, had a minor tangle with
            Barichello on the run in to the hairpin and in a
            split second, off line and, trying to avoid the two
            Saubers, the Peugeot Jordan collided with Panis
            damaging both cars' suspensions. Team Ligier too, witnessed
            their number one driver making the short walk back to
            base even before the whiff of exhaust fumes had vacated
            the pit lane. Jos Verstappen at Stavelot, had a massive
            high speed shunt into the tyre wall completely removing
            the left hand side of his car. Obviously shaken, he was
            helped from his car and into an air ambulance. At
            this crucial point the Safety Car was brought out and
            both Schumacher and Alesi dived into the pits for a
            quick top up. Villeneuve and Hill missed their
            chances and had to wait for a further lap to take
            advantage of the procession of slow moving cars. In
            the confusion, and with pit to car radios not functioning,
            Team Williams, after expecting Hill in for refueling
            found that the 'window' had closed and it was Villeneuve
            that was to be first. This left Hill in the embarrassing
            position of finding himself halfway down the pit lane
            entrance with no room at the inn. A hasty reroute through
            a makeshift chicane in the emergency lane saw him back
            on the track back down in twelfth position with a lot
            of egg on his face. The second round of pit stops
            changed the order briefly, Schumacher pitting before
            Villeneuve and passing the Canadian on his exit from
            the pit lane a lap later. With Hakinen in third,
            Alesi fourth and Coulthard fifth, Hill in sixth found
            himself being worried by a demented Berger fresh from
            a lightning pit stop. That seemed to be the final
            order until Coulthard spun out with 8 or so laps to
            go giving Hill an extra point at the chequered flag.
            So, with Schumacher unwittingly helping to soften the
            blow of Hill's poor showing by keeping the points
            difference between the two Williams drivers to four,
            ( the equivalent of a one - two finish), Ferrari took
            their second win of the season and an impressive one
            to boot. Had not poor pit stop discipline again
            affected both Hill and Villeneuve, the result might
            have been different. However, Hill still only needed
            to finish second to Villeneuve in the remaining three
            Grands Prix to take the crown or an outright win at
            Monza (with Villeneuve out of the points), would have clinched
            it. However, judging by Hill's late season performance,
            this would seem a tall order.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>O</strong></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Monza
            was all about tyres and the abundance thereof</strong>.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">All of
            the front running drivers were to fall foul of the
            hastily mounted tyre barriers at the first Goodyear
            chicane, erected to prevent the cutting of corners
            onto the concrete rumble areas, part of which
            Villeneuve had dislodged in practice the day before.
            With the championship in the bag for Hill, with a win
            here -and it was looking like it might be- the crown
            would be his for the taking. From pole however, Hill
            was beaten to the first corner by Alesi going like a
            train from third on the grid. Hill in
            uncharacteristically forceful mood, passed Alesi at
            Lesmo and held off a passing move from the Benetton driver
            a little further on at the Ascari Chicane. From there
            on the Williams pulled away until contact with that
            tyre barrier on the sixth lap, put him out of the
            running. ' I just have to admit to making a mistake'
            He said later. 'There's no one to blame except
            myself. That was probably quite an easy race victory
            and I threw it away&quot;. He was not the only driver
            to be caught out there as Salo did the same a lap
            later and indeed Schumacher was to skirmish with them
            within 5 laps of the finish. With tyres rolling all
            over the place Villeneuve and Coulthard both fell
            foul to the tyres as did Hakkinen who on lap 4 had to
            pit for a replacement nose cone and did a brilliant
            job to take third place behind Alesi. Irvine clipped them
            on lap 24breaking his front suspension. Hill
            meanwhile waited, a worried man , in the Williams
            motor home to see where Villeneuve would place
            himself. A lowly seventh place would therefore, not
            trouble him and they would both go into the
            penultimate round with the scores unchanged, although one
            less race to score points in, would mean that the advantage
            would fall to Hill. Still, it was the day Ferrari was
            to come good in front of a home crowd. Pi stops put Schumacher
            out in front of Alesi to take the flag and the adulation
            of the Tifosi. Schumacher could now be lionised and,
            irrespective of his position in the Championship standings,
            it was a hero's victory, sealing his name in the annals
            of Ferrari legend.</font><img src="ms02bg96.jpg"

            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>O</strong></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>From
            an extremely slender pole</strong>, Hill made one of
            the best start of the season at Estoril and was no doubt
            glad to see not Villeneuve, but Alesi and behind him,
            Schumacher, in his mirror. It was obvious that
            Schumacher was holding Villeneuve up and all the time Hill
            was pulling away to what looked like a decisive
            victory and the world title. The Canadian, anxious to
            pass the Ferrari, set himself up for a move on the
            extremely fast Parabolica leading to the pit
            straight. 'He was going slowly before the last turn'
            said Villeneuve, 'hoping I would stay behind, but we
            got him on the outside. I think my oval experience
            helped a little bit...it was a lot of fun'. Coming round
            the outside of the Ferrari, he pulled ahead slowly
            and stayed put. There was little in it as the two
            cars running at full pelt towards the start finish
            line, traded bare inches with each other at over 160
            miles an hour. Schumacher gaining ground and then
            Villeneuve. Ahead on the left hand side of the track and
            immediately ahead of Villeneuve, the Minardi of
            Lavagi was rapidly closing. Being the great and
            experienced driver that he is, Schumacher saw an
            impending situation of extreme danger and whilst not
            needing to give ground to his assailant, moved over
            to allow Villeneuve through who, by the skin of his
            teeth whipped round the Minardi to clear air. A victory
            for such an audacious and inspired manoeuvre was surly
            deserved. Mid race saw Villeneuve reeling in the
            other Williams and by the final set of stops on laps
            49 and 50, the distance behind Hill was barely a
            second. He must have known that the sands of time
            were running out and one could sense the relief of
            Villeneuve as Hill dived for the pits. In what was to
            be crucial timing, Hill was stationary for 8.8
            seconds. Villeneuve, out on the track, had his pedal
            to the metal in an attempt to make up the odd second
            before he made his final stop. After being stationary
            for 8 tenths of a second less than Hill, he blasted
            from the pit lane barely under the other William's'
            front wing. There was barely a sheet of paper between
            them. ' I was quite surprised to see him pop out in front
            of me'. Hill said afterwards. Villeneuve by now, had control
            of the race and it was really all over bar the
            shouting. The Championship as so many times before,
            would be contested finally, in Japan.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>O</strong></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>And
            so it was</strong>, that despite all the options open
            to both Hill and Villeneuve, of race strategy and
            also, despite inter-team rivalry in the most
            honourable tradition, Hill took the lead from the
            beginning in a magnificent blast from second place closely
            followed by Berger, to lead the race in its entirety. The
            race was not without its incidents however. Alesi,
            putting his car into the gravel at the first corner,
            renewed the rumours of expulsion, whilst his team
            mate in bullish mood, tried pointlessly to wrest the
            lead at the final chicane on lap 5, obviously
            thinking that Hill just wasn't going fast enough. Getting
            it all wrong, as the Williams held it's line,
            Berger's wing made contact with the raised concrete
            edging of the corner and sent him scuttling off to
            the pits for a new nose section. Hill did not see it
            as a problem. &quot;I heard an engine noise and I
            kept my line. I looked in my mirror and he was a long
            way back. It was not a problem.&quot; After a kindly
            move by Irvine to let Villeneuve through and several
            fastest laps, the energy in Villeneuve's driving made
            it obvious that he was consistently the quickest man
            on the circuit and it was only a matter of time
            before he started to reel in the Champion elect. The
            battle royal between the two title challengers, we assumed,
            was about to commence. Sadly this was not to be.
            Disaster struck for Jacques Villeneuve at that point.
            He had radio'ed to team chief Patrick Head, that he
            was experiencing an imbalance on his right rear wheel
            yet he was not expecting to see the said article pass
            his line of vision, bounce over his front right tyre
            and like a malevolent UFO, fly off into the packed
            crowd. Fortunately no one was hurt, which probably
            could not be said about Villeneuve's feelings. Yet
            for a man who has just seen his World Championship
            chances go spinning away over the barriers, he seemed
            resigned and relaxed. Had this happened to Hill, we
            would have seen a broken man sagging by the wayside
            and heard nothing but indirect suggestions of
            sabotage. Hill was now the New World Champion no
            matter what happened and it was now just a matter of
            keeping his car together for the final 17 laps. His
            gap in front of Schumacher stayed constant, the top three
            places by now firmly established, Hakkinen having the speed
            to stay with the Ferrari, but not the outright power
            to build any kind of overtaking manoeuvre. Further
            down the field and out of the points Coulthard and
            Herbert were having a lively spar for 9th place. So
            there it was, as Villeneuve walked round the long way
            Damon Hill took the chequered flag to put his dream
            to rest. Like father, Like son. The hill dynasty now,
            taking up two of the 8 UK champions of the World. The
            first person he went to after he stepped from his car
            in the Parc Ferme, was to Georgie his wife and
            devoted campaigner of his sportsmanship. Amid
            tumultuous applause he embraced her long and hard and
            then a little bit more. </font></p>

            the spectacle and the racing. Alesi and Berger,
            mischievous both, were dogged by misfortune and ill
            timed judgment and their team should look at a
            serious regrouping strategy over the recess. The boys from
            McLaren had an extremely positive year and acquitted themselves
            with honour. This house will definitely be in the honours
            list next year. Sauber, Jordan and Ligier all had moments
            of glory, but not enough to separate them from the front
            runners and they could all do with a 'between term' reappraisal
            of their Strategies too. </font><img
