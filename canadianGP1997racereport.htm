        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="5" face="Arial"><b>McLaren&#146;s
            choice gives Schumacher victory as race is stopped
            after Panis crashes.</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><img
            src="ccan97.gif" align="left" hspace="0" width="170"
            height="121"></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;I&#146;m
            always pleased for 10 points, but there&#146;s no
            point in celebrating a victory in these
            circumstances.&quot;</i> So said <b>Michael
            Schumacher</b>, the winner of the 19th Canadian Grand
            Prix in Montreal. The race was curtailed on the 56th
            lap of 69, after <b>Olivier Panis</b>, losing the
            rear of his <b>Prost Mugen-Honda</b>, kissed a
            barrier that sent him ricocheting to the other side
            of the track, hitting a wall of tyres at 140 mph. He
            was immediately air-lifted to the Sacre Coeur
            hospital in Montreal with multiple closed fractures
            of both legs. He is said not to be in any danger.
            Schumacher went on to echo the sentiments of the
            drivers, all of whom shared a universal concern for
            the injured Frenchman. <i>&quot;I am very happy to
            hear that Panis' injuries are not too serious, as at
            the moment that is the most important thing.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was an air of
            glumness as the winner held his trophy aloft, not
            only from the three triumphant drivers present on the
            podium, but from the crowd too, who, in addition to
            the dismay of Panis&#146; accident, had been robbed
            of the one thing that they wanted to see most, their
            local hero, <b>Jacques Villeneuve</b> embracing the
            adoration of the crowd under the glory of the
            Canadian flag, to the emotive sounds of their
            National Anthem.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was a race of high
            incident and again, as in Spain, tyres played a major
            role in the outcome of the race. As the lights went
            out, Schumacher made his characteristic lightening
            getaway, whilst Villeneuve fumbled for grip. Quick
            off the mark also was the<b> Benetton Renault</b> of <b>Jean
            Alesi</b> and <b>Giancarlo Fisichella&#146;s Jordan
            Peugeot</b>, who immediately started to harry the
            Canadian for second place. With <b>David Coulthard</b>&#146;s
            <b>McLaren</b> and the other Jordan of <b>Ralf
            Schumacher</b> clear of the rest of the field at the <i>Senna
            Hairpin</i>, the second half of the field bunching
            uncomfortably together, started to negotiate the
            tricky left/right hander. In a portent to future
            events, perhaps, Olivier Panis changed the face of
            the race by letting his car slip momentarily from his
            control, driving into and removing, the rear wing
            from <b>Mika Hakkinen</b>&#146;s <b>McLaren</b>. The
            wing, acting like a scatter bomb amid the oncoming
            traffic, took out <b>Eddie Irvine</b>&#146;s <b>Ferrari
            </b>straight away. <i>&quot;I made a good
            start,&quot;</i> said Irvine, <i>&quot;but everyone
            was crowding into the corner. I noticed Panis and
            Wurz on the outside line and on the second corner I
            got past them on the outside. But two cars touched in
            front of me and a piece of bodywork went under my
            rear tyre which made me spin and the engine cut
            out.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Johnny Herbert</b>
            in the <b>Sauber </b>was next to clip it, sending it
            into the Path of <b>Damon Hill</b> who was lucky to
            limit the damage to his <b>Arrows</b> by riding over
            the debris with his front left tyre. Meanwhile Both <b>Shinji
            Nakano,</b> Panis&#146; team mate and <b>Jan
            Magnussen</b> in the <b>Stewart Ford</b> collided in
            their attempts to avoid the rogue body part. For
            Magnussen it was &#145;race over&#146; too. <i>&quot;I
            was running close with Nakano when we had to avoid
            Panis&#146; wing (sic)&quot;</i> the Dane said. <i>&quot;I
            tried to go round the outside, he went the other way.
            When I began accelerating again, he seemed to
            fish-tail as he came round. He side-swiped me and I
            hit the barrier.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Feverish pit stops
            ensued with Panis going in for a new front section,
            and Hill to check his wheel balance. Hakkinen
            didn&#146;t make it back out, an unfortunate victim
            of yet another first corner fiasco.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Further fiascoes were
            to follow as the beleaguered Villeneuve, coming not
            only to the end of a grueling week of media and
            beurocratic pressures, but to the end of his second
            lap, misjudged the corner leading onto the pit strait
            and tucked it neatly into the wall. As the 120,000
            crowd, watching on giant monitors, let out a
            collective groan, the Canadian in a gesture of
            &#145;How stupid can I get?&#146; smacked his hand
            against the side of his helmeted head and stalked
            away, no doubt fuming at the basic error he had made.
            <i>&quot;The track was very slippery and I just
            misjudged the corner.&quot;</i> Said Villeneuve <i>&quot;I
            didn't really expect to go sideways going into the
            turn. I made a big mistake and I am highly
            disappointed.&quot;</i> So were the crowd who started
            to vacate their seats even at that early stage.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This placed Fisichella
            in a strong second place and on a charge to keep
            Schumacher within range, setting an early fast lap in
            doing so. Panis having dropped to 18th, was setting
            the trail alight and also setting fastest laps.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Turn 9 was the scene
            of the next incident when <b>Ukyo Katayama </b>put
            his <b>Minardi</b> into the tyre wall leaving a
            serious mess on the track which put the race under a
            course yellow flag forcing the field to close up
            behind the safety car for 4 laps. To add to
            William&#146;s woes, <b>Heinz Harald Frentzen</b> was
            having a troubled time with blistering rear tyres
            similar to that which he suffered in Spain and had to
            pit early on lap 10 for fresh rubber. This was to be
            rather futile as the problem persisted throughout the
            race and in spite of three more stops, the German was
            lucky to hold on to a final fourth place. With a
            gaggle of cars getting back into their stride,
            Schumacher started to pull out a useful lead whilst
            further back down the road <b>Jos Verstappen</b> in
            an unusually aggressive <b>Tyrrell </b>was tangling
            with a leaden <b>Rubens Barichello</b> who was very
            shortly to fall prey to <b>Mika Salo</b> and to <b>Johnny
            Herbert</b>. It was not to be the Stewart
            driver&#146;s day, a gearbox selection fault was to
            put him out on the 34th lap. Commenting on a
            thoroughly disappointing weekend that started with so
            much promise, Barichello said, <i>&quot;I just got
            bogged down at the start-maybe the car was too heavy
            with the fuel load we were running. I had so much
            trouble in my fight with Salo. It was impossible to
            hold on.&quot;</i> He continued, <i>&quot;Maybe in
            the changing track conditions we had the wrong setup.
            In the end I had a problem with the gears and I
            couldn&#146;t select 6th.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ralf Schumacher</b>
            running well in 5th, suffered what he thought was a
            deflated tyre and he too slid of the track, running
            along the Armco like a billiard ball down a cushion
            and into the waiting jaws of a tyre wall. He walked
            away resigned to the fact that there was little that
            he could have done. <i>&quot;It felt like a puncture
            in my left rear tyre,&quot; </i>explained the German.<i>
            &quot;But now I have looked at the telemetry with my
            engineers, we can not tell if this is actually the
            case. At the moment we do not have an explanation for
            what happened.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first round of
            stops changed the race order. Fisichella and Alesi
            pitted at the same time on lap 26, but the Jordan
            team apparently caught by the Italian&#146;s
            unscheduled stop, produced a ragged tyre change
            giving the Frenchman the advantage, leaving the pit
            lane two seconds ahead of Fisichella. Coulthard on a
            one stop strategy inherited the lead on lap 28, as
            Schumacher pitted with heavily blistered rear tyres
            gaining 10 seconds on the Ferrari and 25 seconds over
            Alesi now in 3rd place. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the positions on
            the front runners unchanged Coulthard made his only
            intended stop on lap 40 handing the lead back to
            Schumacher who had yet to make his last stop. With
            Herbert into fifth on the same strategy as the
            McLaren, but temporarily forfeiting his place with a
            ten second &#145;stop &amp; go&#146; penalty for pit
            lane speeding, it looked like the race was duly won
            by the Scotsman who regained a strong lead of over
            thirty seconds after Schumacher&#146;s second pit
            stop on lap 44.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By this time <b>Gerhard
            Berger</b>&#146;s temporary replacement and fellow
            Austrian, <b>Alexander Wurz</b> had retired with a
            broken drive shaft on lap 37 after a brilliant first
            drive for the team and Verstappen, shining brightly
            if briefly for Tyrrell, suffering from a jammed
            gearbox, retired on lap 44.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Excitement and despair
            were to come shortly however, when Schumacher,
            obviously in trouble, made an unscheduled stop with
            badly pitted tyres only 6 laps later. This gave
            Coulthard a seemingly unassailable lead of over 30
            seconds, but his tyres too were on the way out and it
            was down to team boss <b>Ron Dennis</b> to make the
            decision to bring him in. <i>&quot;I had to take
            responsibility for the call.&quot;</i> said a
            philosophical Dennis after the race. <i>&quot;We
            could have carried on with the blistered tyres or we
            could have had a puncture.&quot;</i> Coulthard duly
            pitted on lap 52, and with the fresh problem of a
            faulty clutch, he stalled the engine. As they tried
            in vain to get the McLaren out ahead of the German,
            the pitch of the crowd rose as the Ferrari approached
            the final turn into the pit straight and as it roared
            past the start finish line the crowd erupted with
            glee to the extent that it could almost have been
            Schumacher&#146;s home Grand Prix rather than the, by
            now forgotten, Villeneuve&#146;s.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Coulthard was lost
            either way when Panis crashed and the safety car
            bought the race to a halt with the positions standing
            as of lap 54. Had he stayed out on the track for
            another lap and a half, the race would have been his.
            Had his tyres blown out it would have made no
            difference. It was Dennis&#146; choice and the whole
            team will have to live with it.<i> &quot;I&#146;m not
            quite sure what happened.&quot; </i>Said Coulthard,
            Putting on a remarkably brave face. <i>&quot;I had a
            small problem before my first stop when I almost
            didn&#146;t get the gear. We only pitted because
            Michael pitted and we thought we had a big enough
            advantage and we thought it was the right thing to
            do, just in case there was another pace car and
            clearly it worked against us this time. It was my
            race, but that&#146;s motor racing.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fisichella followed
            second placed Alesi home, 6 tenths of a second
            behind. Excellent results for both teams, needing the
            credibility of podium finishes. Frentzen took 4th,
            salvaging another rotten weekend for Williams. It
            looks like they will have to wait a little longer to
            attain the magical 100 Grand Prix wins and it is now
            by no means certain that it will come sooner than
            later. <i>&quot;I still find the new two pedal set-up
            difficult.&quot; </i>Frentzen said after the race.<i>
            &quot;I started totally differently here then what I
            normally do. It took the clutch a very long time to
            grip and I had tyre problems after just four laps. It
            was difficult for me to keep up as my left rear was
            blistering.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Herbert held on to his
            well deserved fifth position and Panis&#146; team
            mate Nakano, ironically in the points for the first
            time, rounded of the top six. Damon Hill should have
            been jubilant having actually <i>finished,</i> albeit
            still not a full race distance, in 9th place. <i>&quot;It
            was a very lonely race, I was dead last for a long
            time.&quot; </i>He said,<i> &quot;I paid careful
            attention to engine revs and I had a vibration
            related to hitting Hakkinen&#146;s wing, but it was
            nothing more than a wheel weight problem.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With scenes of Panis
            being lifted from the wreckage of his car,
            distressing memories of <b>Ayrton Senna</b>&#146;s
            crash at Imola in 1994, resurfaced and it is certain
            that the safety aspects of the track at Montreal will
            now come under scrutiny. Michael Schumacher a key
            figure in the Grand Prix Drivers&#146; Association,
            said: <i>&quot;We will discuss the safety issues with
            the </i><b><i>FIA</i></b><i>. We have improved safety
            and we shall continue to look after it. That&#146;s
            why the GPDA is so important.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There were no
            Champagne showers, the bottles stayed on the podium.
            No one felt like celebrating and it is to all the
            drivers&#146; credit that their one concern was for
            the well-being of a member of a family and despite
            it&#146;s off-track squabbles and public
            denouncements, in times of crisis, it closes ranks to
            show the world that there <i>is </i>an acceptable
            human face to the real live danger and macho
            posturing of Motor racing.</font></p>
