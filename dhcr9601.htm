        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="520">In a shock
        announcement today at a press conference in fashionable
        Chelsea harbour, Damon Hill announced his intentions to
        drive for the Arrows team of Tom Walkinshaw Racing.
        Shortly before struggling with the cork on a bottle of
        Moet &amp; Chandon, he said: &#147;I have had to look for
        the best package I can find and one that gives me all the
        ingredients I am looking for as a driver. Tom has
        fulfilled just about every criteria I set out for
        myself.&#148; He went on, &#147;There is the opportunity
        to make rapid progress with a team, to test and develop
        and the carrot at the end, is the possibility of winning
        races.&#148;<p>On the face of it, this seems like a
        rather optimistic view, seeing as this season, the Arrows/Footwork-Hart
        team have scored but a single point and with the
        rejection of the trusty but uncompetitive Hart power unit
        for the equally insignificant Yamaha, their future looks
        bleak indeed. </p>
        <p>Having pushed the Tyrell team into relative obscurity
        over the past three years, rumours of Yamaha&#146;s
        intention to quit Formula 1 for financial reasons were
        rife, but the signing with TWR may only perpetuate their
        reputation for unreliability despite the kudos of a top
        line driver. </p>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="260">A &#145;sweetened&#146; deal
        with Japanese tyre manufacturer Bridgestone could also be
        a factor in Hill&#146;s decision to join the tail enders.
        It is for certain that they would benefit from a driver
        of Hill&#146;s testing and development capabilities and
        possibly start their Formula one involvement with a psychological
        advantage over Goodyear by sporting the magic number 1 on
        the nose of the Arrows car. <p>With guarded optimism not
        dissimilar to Michael Schumacher&#146;s comments last year,
        Hill continued, &#147;We won&#146;t make any claims for
        1997, but I believe we will make rapid progress. From
        what I have seen of the Tom Walkinshaw operation there is
        a germ of a great team for the future.&#148; Schumacher
        was of course joining Ferrari and despite his talk of
        &#145;a year of consolidation&#146; and not making claims
        for the 1996 season he went on to take three Grands Prix.
        True, Hill has the experience and speed to push the car a few
        positions up the grid but to think about anything other
        than an early plane out, shows faith in abundance. For
        Hill to even think that his new team stands the remotest
        chance of a victory in &#146;97 seems nieve in the
        extreme and it is significant that despite his comments,
        he has only signed for the coming season. </p>
        <p>The reasons as to why Hill chose a rank outsider, have
        to be examined. If Eric Cantona went to play for
        Barminster Rovers it would be because he had been relegated.
        Yet Hill had the choice of a middle team such as Jordan
        with proven form and much promise and surely a much
        stronger contender for &#145;a great team of the
        future&#146;. Another germ of greatness about to start
        breeding, is Jackie Stewart&#146;s brand new outfit.
        Surely a team to grow with and one that could make
        &#145;rapid progress&#146;. Altruism on Hill&#146;s part
        seems unlikely, as baby sitting Jos Verstappen would be a
        pointless exercise. Verstappen has probably gone as far
        as he will go on the learning curve and Tom Walkinshaw
        would have little need for an expensive &#145;driving
        instructor&#146;. </p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#808080" size="3"><em>Another
        perspective on Hill's move is that it could in fact turn
        out to be his shrewdest move ever. Damon Hill knows who
        Tom Walkinshaw is and he'll be perfectly aware that the
        team principal is a known winner. Whether working with
        Jaguar to win Le Mans, or developing winning BTCC cars, TWR
        (Tom Walkinshaw Racing) have a track record that's the
        envy of motorsport. TWR took over Arrows, also known as
        Footwork-Hart earlier this season and started work on
        next year's car while using the 1996 season as a
        development year. Next year the team will have the works
        Yamaha and Bridgestone deals - the strong Japanese tie in
        will lead to all sorts of possibilities and the chances
        of a high level of finance from Japan is quite likely -
        that could be enough to raise the team from 'also-ran' to
        'winner'.</em></font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#808080" size="3"><em>The
        engineering facilities now available to Arrows are second
        to none - if they can't succeed within TWR then they
        never will. But the likelihood is that they actually will
        do well. Hill's other options included Stewart Grand Prix
        - so far unknown and without quite as much of an all-round
        track record as TWR, and Jordan who had recently signed Michael
        Schumacher's younger brother Ralf. However, you can
        imagine the media attention that Hill being paired with
        Schumacher's brother would have raised - so it wasn't
        quite as palatable option as immediately evident.</em></font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#808080" size="3"><em>On the
        face of it, a careless move that could cost Hill dearly -
        but on the other hand there is every chance that he could
        rise with TWR and help make Arrows a formidable force for
        the first time in its history. Should that happen then
        Damon Hill would be lionised. Just like Michael
        Schumacher now is for helping in Ferrari's renaissance.</em></font> </p>

        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="520">To bring the
        small team to glory, to play the underdog and come out
        barking and for Walkinshaw to thank Damon keeping faith
        in him through the long dark tunnel of ridicule, is the
        stuff of Hollywood movies and one which will probably
        never get made. Probably a few top drivers - some maybe
        privately snickering behind their racing gloves - are
        thinking &#145;there but for the grace of the lord go
        I&#146;. It is hard not to view Hill now without seeing a
        dent in his stature, a &#145;would be&#146; champion
        backed into a corner and going for an undoubtedly large
        purse. This must be the reason. No matter what one
        drives, the true measure of a driver&#146;s worth is the
        money one can command. Even driving a Forti with pockets
        bulging with millions would give one equal status to the
        top teams and yet provide an excuse for lack of driving
        ability in running with an uncompetitive car.<p>This is,
        I am sure, not Hill&#146;s intent and he will definitely
        do all he can within the team to gain points next year.
        Who knows, by buying in the right designer, producing a speedboat
        instead of a canoe, and with a prevailing wind and (a
        strong wind at that) a reliable engine, he will not have
        cause to relive his first year in Formula 1 with the rapidly
        disintegrating Brabham team. Yet he will be safe in the
        knowledge that little will be expected of him in his new
        role as middle man, save for an irregular showing inside
        the top six. This maybe unkind and it would be heroic and
        the stuff from which &#145;Ripping Yarns&#146; are hewn
        if the fairy tale could come true, but Hill can at least
        say that he had the best and if he gets the drivers crown
        in Japan, he will at least have some laurels to rest on
        for the early part of the season. </p>
        <p>The bottle of Champagne that he opens after the race
        at Suzuka in two weeks time had better be savoured as it
        could be his last for quite a while. </p>
