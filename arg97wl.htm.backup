            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Olivier Panis: </u>Hung
            on to the coat-tails of a Williams-Renault with a
            huge fuel load in a car that just isn&#146;t quite
            what Mr Villeneuve has at his disposal is a
            remarkable achievement. From a fantastic grid
            position (anyone remember a Ligier being up that far
            before?) he stormed through the first corner and gave
            the hapless H-H Frentzen a good scare before the
            untimely demise of a brilliant first lap scuffle
            between the three of them. Unfortunately, for all
            concerned, not least Alain Prost and Bridgestone, the
            Mugen-Honda had an uncharacteristic failure.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Rubens Barrichello:
            </u>After being clobbered by a double world champion,
            it usually is best to get out and apologise for being
            in his way. Not Rubens. He nipped around to the pits
            and had a new nose slapped on, rejoined the race, and
            did a great impression of a scythe. He rattled many a
            cage as he slashed his way forward and put up a
            respectable fight before the now traditional Stewart
            failure. Both he and Magnussen put on a great show
            and had there been a decent director on the scene, we
            would have seen the tartan cars. It now seems <i>de
            rigeur </i>that host South American networks treat us
            to fantastic shots of gravel traps and empty track
            (see <i>Losers</i>). </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Jan Magnussen: </u>For
            having the patience to swap cars with Barrichello
            throughout qualifying as two out of their three cars
            were stricken with problems. Lucky one isn&#146;t
            three feet taller than the other. Magnussen had a
            reasonable race, let down by the crap Ford engines.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Jacques Villeneuve:
            </u>Marvellous. He had the squitters all weekend but
            still managed, after yet another disastrous Williams
            strategy decision (tyre option and three stops), to
            hang on. He would have been feeling like
            yesterday&#146;s seafood and probably cursing that
            bump on turn 15 (or 14&#133;wherever) which
            threatened to unseat whatever extra baggage he was
            carrying within. It does help that Adrian Newey made
            all the right decisions about the car this time last
            year. He held off a firework-like performance from
            Olivier Panis in the early stages and Eddie Irvine in
            the closing. He made it through the first turn
            unscathed (there&#146;s something new) and created
            opportunities to warm-up their tyres with some canny
            work behind the pace car. This, however, does not
            mean I like him.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Mika Hakkinen:</u>
            Coming from sixteenth to fifth on what had been a
            very difficult weekend for him. <u>Eddie Irvine: </u>for
            giving us a race, sticking it up the rabid Italian
            press and also managing to stay clear of the mess at
            the first turn.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Damon Hill:</u> For
            being eternally cheery in the face Alesi-adversity.
            For being undeniably amusing whilst talking to the
            BBC saying &quot;it was all very exciting&quot; about
            three times in the interview. He&#146;s making huge
            progress with that awful car and Mr Diniz deserves a
            hand too. Both made absolutely massive starts, Hill
            from thirteenth to seventh and Diniz from dead last
            to somewhere in the low-teens. Maybe the Yamaha has
            some decent low-down torque?</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Michael Schumacher:
            </u>Look at the money this guy gets paid. How could
            he be a loser? Apart from the fact he drove into
            Rubens Barrichello. Barrichello is but a minion.</font></p>

            Frentzen: </u>(<i>sigh</i>) Here we are again.
            Through no fault of his own (at this stage, anyway)
            the car sputtered to a halt and he was forced to
            watch his team mate walk home with ten points. (<i>sigh</i>)</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Heinz-Harald
            Frentzen: </u>For allowing the revelation that he was
            short-shifting 3000 rpm from the redline in Brazil to
            avoid a retirement to get out. What is he on? All
            these people who were saying Frentzen is a born racer
            have been very quiet so far this year. (<i>bigger
            sigh</i>)</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Williams: </u>For
            hiring Frentzen. Stupid, stupid, stupid&#133;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Yamaha:</u> Two
            engines going in one race. Clever. I hear Tom has
            been chatting to Mugen-Honda. Apparently he&#146;s
            after an engine that can finish a race. This is all
            speculation, you understand. The very thought that he
            would want to finish a race may seem laughable to
            some, but apparently this is one of his goals. Go
            figure. Maybe Yamaha are in competition with the
            works Ford for &#145;highest number of detonations in
            a year.&#146; Or maybe &#145;least powerful works
            engine deal.&#146;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Jean Alesi:</u> A
            regular visitor to the Losers section, he&#146;s
            managed it again. Driving into Damon Hill was
            probably the most outstanding of his other,
            admittedly smaller blunders, particularly when he
            actually had Hill and Damon had just about conceded
            when the stupidest of the stupid drove straight into
            him. &quot;Crazy&quot; Alesi (I won&#146;t use that
            nickname again) seems not so much a loose cannon, as
            a rampant US Marine Corps with an order to use deadly
            force at will. Alesi&#146;s colossal stupidity seems
            to have rubbed off on <u>Gerhard Berger</u> over the
            seasons as he gets sillier and sillier as well. He
            waited until the dying laps before putting his foot
            down, setting and re-setting the lap record. Very
            clever. Flavio must be trying to re-write the
            performance-based contract with Mild Seven as we
            speak.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Benetton:</u> For
            keeping both of the Terrible Two for a second season
            when there was a realistic chance of a decent driver
            joining them, in Giancarlo Fisichella. Dumping Alesi,
            even with a contract payout must surely be the most
            sensible move as he probably averages at least
            $100,000 damage per race, if not more. A more stable
            driver would bring in points and income from both
            race winnings and the sponsor. Gerhard should just be
            put out to pasture to play with his daughters.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Ralf Schumacher:</u>
            What a clever piece of PR work. A team that
            desperately needs the points in order to keep the
            Peugeot were running two-three, looking great. Well,
            obviously Schumacher junior felt he ought to be in
            front so he took an excursion over the kerbs and
            clobbered poor old Giancarlo rather hard. Young Ralf
            seems to have the same attitude his brother had in
            &#145;94 and &#146;95 &#150; if you can&#146;t pass
            &#145;em, hit &#145;em.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>The Idiot in the
            pace car:</u> This was one of the highlights of the
            race &#150; listening to Martin and Murray give the
            pace car driver a good whacking. He was a
            &#145;clown&#146; as Martin so gently put it. He
            should have been going ballistic and sticking the
            thing onto two wheels at every corner. Imola &#146;94
            demonstrated the need for some talent in the pace car
            and it was only Jacques Villeneuve&#146;s push-pull
            technique that kept any semblance of heat in the
            tyres. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>The TV director:</u>
            Oh, man. What a fool. We could so nearly have missed
            Eddie Irvine either punting JV off or getting past
            him and giving him the finger. Instead we got to see
            a bunch of flag-waving Ferrari fans. Who taught this
            guy how to build suspense and anguish in an audience,
            Hitchcock? We got some fantastic shots of empty
            track, the backs of cars going around corners, the
            type of thing the South Americans are becoming famous
            for. It was very ordinary. At least we had some
            sound, but in Australia, at least, the picture kept
            freezing and dropping out. Let&#146;s get to Imola,
            please. Even one-eyed Ferrari watching is better than
            what we&#146;ve put up with.</font></p>
