            Leicestershire, England</strong></font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><img
            src="chc97aa.jpg" width="350" height="248"><br>
            </strong></font><font size="1" face="Arial">Chris
            Hermann, smiling too much for my liking... (Ed)</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After my last minute
            decision to enter my Mazda RX-7 in the fledgling
            Historic Group 2 series this year back at the start
            of March, I was rewarded with a win first time out in
            my (new to me) car. The much more important Formula
            Saloons championship was always going to be an
            altogether more challenging prospect.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The weeks leading up
            to the race weekend have been cold, but dry.
            International readers may not be award that Britain
            is already facing what it calls drought conditions in
            much of the country, but sure enough the weekend
            started off with heavy rain. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is an odd
            situation, but in all the years I have been racing,
            on and off since 1977 in fact but more off than on
            due to a lack of money, I had never yet had a wet
            race, so I was half looking forward to it and half
            fearful. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Certainly, on the plus
            side a wet race would have given me more of a
            fighting chance with my 320bhp Rotary engined Mazda.
            On the negative side, the short Mallory park circuit
            with its relatively narrow track, 120-130 mph
            approach to the 30 mph (no run off) Shaw's hairpin
            and 'killer corners' such as the very fast 190 degree
            Gerrards Bend and aptly named off camber flat out
            Devil's Elbow might have be a bit iffy for the
            Brutish Formula Saloons - some of which now have well
            over 600 bhp. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Qualifying started on
            a slightly damp track, and I immediately found that I
            had a reoccurrence of the brake problems which left
            me languishing in 17th in the Group 2 race in March,
            but completed enough laps to qualify and 17th again
            was not too disheartening under the circumstances.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of much more concern
            was the incident which red flagged the session. Simon
            Dickinson, who had only recently obtained his 1994
            Mallock prepared ex South African Super Touring Car
            Vauxhall Cavalier put the car onto its roof at the
            hairpin. Because I had returned to the pits with my
            brake problems, the first I knew of it was when an
            official told me the session was red flagged. Shortly
            afterwards I saw his father and crew chief (himself a
            former British Saloon Car Champion) and his mother
            and brother looking very worried some time after the
            session had stopped.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As I write this on
            Monday afternoon, it now looks like Simon is very
            bruised and has stretched tendons, but is otherwise
            OK and is expected home tonight, good news as up
            until quite late on Sunday afternoon there was real
            concern that he had broken his back and neck. It was
            only after 6pm that he was removed from the
            braceboard.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Simon remembers the
            incident well. Apparently his throttle stuck open as
            he went into the braking area for Shaw's. I was told
            by Simon's mother this morning that he says he had
            lots of time to prepare for the impact, switch off
            the engine and relax for the impact and that he
            recalls rolling at least three times. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">None of this did much
            for my peace of mind as I contemplated whether to
            race, knowing the brakes to be 'iffy' or to just call
            it a day.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the end, the lure
            was too great. I suspect that anyone who actually
            races does so as much as anything because of the need
            to challenge and push themselves and I am no
            different. The start money was an added temptation,
            but one the lights changed all thoughts of simply
            circulating went out the window.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When you're hot,
            you're hot as they say - and I definitely was not on
            a roll this weekend.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On lap two of the 15
            lap race I picked up a driveline vibration - itself a
            reoccurrence of the events of the Silverstone Group 2
            race. Unlike that occasion, I was not to win, but I
            had worked my way up to third in class - which I held
            in sufficient comfort to make way for the much faster
            Class A cars dicing for outright victory as they came
            through. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Similarly, when the
            third and forth placed cars came through, I again
            made way, only this time they were a little slower
            than I expected, forcing me to run wide onto the
            marbles on the exit to Gerrards. As I said at the
            start, this is a very fast, long corner and even
            being off line and going slower than usual I was
            still on the high side of 110 mph and heading
            straight for the tyre wall. Damp grass and slicks are
            not good bed fellows, but somehow I managed to hold
            it all together although having avoided the tyre wall
            I then thought for a moment I was going to career off
            to the other side as the back came round wildly. When
            it was all over and I rejoined the track forth in
            class Paul Lawrence had drawn up along side and had
            the inside line for the esses. As he had been taking
            two to three car lengths out of me in every braking
            area all through the race I was powerless to do
            anything, and as it was the last lap, fourth in class
            was where I finished.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Given that some people
            are spending more on their tyres than I am for my
            whole season doing two series - including the
            purchase cost of the car - and the brake problems I
            have been having, I am not too unhappy with my
            result. Even the 3.3 seconds adrift in lap times to
            the fastest time in class is not too bad - at least 1
            second of that will come just from fixing the brakes,
            another 0.5 seconds I believe at least is easily
            there in my driving and the slicks I was using have
            now had a full four seasons use and they were
            Michelin's hardest compound to start with - they were
            barely tepid after the race. The consensus of opinion
            is that new tyres would find me at least 2 seconds
            and maybe as much as 3 seconds a lap, so I think the
            car - despite its venerable age - can be modestly
            competitive with a bit of TLC and money which is more
            than I dared hope for when I set out to do the
            series.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even more encouraging,
            despite all the brake and drive line problems, I
            still recorded a time just 0.03 seconds slower than
            the car's previous owner who won class championships
            with it, so I must be doing something right.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next Formula
            Saloon round is at Oulton Park in Cheshire on May 17
            which will also see me doing round two of the
            Historic Group 2/5 Classic Thunder series where I
            know the car is competitive having won Round 1.</font></p>
