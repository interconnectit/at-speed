            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This site
            has been designed to be as easy to use as possible.
            That means that we've kept the layout simple, so that
            there isn't too much to distract the eye when you're
            reading the articles and viewing the pictures, and
            the added advantage is that Speed's pages will load
            quickly.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">However,
            there are a few aids in Speed which are designed to
            make navigation through the site easier and quicker
            than it might otherwise be.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As long
            as you have graphics switched on in your browser (and
            we recommend that you do) then you will see a set of
            icons at the top of the page. They're at the top of
            this page, in fact, although sometimes you'll find
            that not all the possible icons are on display. In a
            current browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer
            3, you'll find that moving your mouse pointer over
            one of these icons will show a tip which provides a
            brief description as to what the icon is about.</font></p>

            instance. If it's underlined then it can be clicked

            of link, but the rest will take you to pages of
            interest that are relevant to the current page you're
            looking at. These won't always be links within Speed,
            but may take you out to a web site of particular
            interest. You can always return to Speed by using
            your browser's 'Back' button, or the history
            facility. At times you'll also find that Interest

            </strong>On some systems, the typeface specified

            side. However, on others it might look just perfect.
            To allow for this, most browsers will allow you to
            specify the font sizes available. You'll usually find
            a button to cycle through the font sizes on your
            browser's toolbar. If not, then try the 'preferences'
            available from the browser menus. If you are still in
            doubt, then consult your browser's help file or
            manual.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We
            recommend that if your browser supports fonts, then
